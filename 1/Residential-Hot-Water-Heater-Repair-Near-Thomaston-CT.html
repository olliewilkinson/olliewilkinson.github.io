<h2>Water Heater Services Thomaston Connecticut</h2>
<p>Many individuals are curious as to when do you need a new water heater. Call Lee's Plumbing: Once the plumbing experts arrive, they will assess the situation and walk you through the necessary repairs. These systems heat the water as it is requested, which is why they are also known as on demand” water heaters. Tankless models only require enough power to heat the amount of water needed at any given moment, meaning they use less energy, which translates to utility savings. It's important for homeowners in Bucks and Montgomery County to also consider the efficiency, cost, and size of their new water heater.</p>
<p>Fortunately, since tankless heaters do not have a tank, there is absolutely zero risk of an explosion ever occurring. Sometimes the hot water tank in the system is the only one used to provide the home with hot water—and many modern solar water tanks come with a built-in electric element for auxiliary heating when the sun isn't shining enough. In commercial settings, manifold systems link multiple tankless units together to dramatically increase their heating capacity while decreasing the individual load.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the type of traditional hot water tank you had, you may be able to install it in the same area.

Our 24-hour emergency plumbers offer a complete range of solutions that can get a faulty system back up and running in no time. Many homeowners are interested in how tankless water heaters can save them money, since these units are more energy efficient than their tank counterparts.</p>
