Are similar to conventional units in that they both burn gas, exhaust flues and store hot water in an insulated tank.

Too much hot water usage can deplete the tank's supply, meaning one unfortunate person gets left with a cold shower.</p>
<p>Scalding water is usually the result of a damaged pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. What it means for you is that using a tankless electric heater you will never run out of hot water while in the shower.
