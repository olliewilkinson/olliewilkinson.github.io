<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element.

Fill the water heater and check for leaks. Our licensed plumbing experts from Mr. Rooter® Plumbing can help you determine whether a tankless water heater is right for your home. The drain cock located at the bottom of the hot water storage tank is where you or a service technician can flush the tank.</p>
<p>If you're using a gas-powered water heater, the burner assembly must be connected to the gas line. This is because the heating coils are in the pipes and ready to heat the water as soon as it is needed.

We proudly offer superior water heater repair services to homeowners throughout Delaware, Southeastern Pennsylvania, Southern New Jersey, and Northeastern Maryland.</p>

This is known as standby energy loss and it's costing you money.

Tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, make hot water only when you need it.

<p>When your water heater breaks down, you want to call someone you can trust. Accordingly, the best place to install a tankless system is directly next to the water fixture. For a simple install with no need to run additional gas lines to a new hookup, an install will take an average of around 3-4 hours for a total installation cost of $150-$600. Over time, even well-maintained water heaters will begin to lose efficiency and develop more problems associated with wear and tear.</p>
<p>Your hot water is rust-colored: This is likely a sign that the inside of your tank is rusting, which means it's aging and breaking down.
