<p>If you need professional water heater installation or replacement, you have come to the right place. Also, test all wires in the water heater with a non-contact voltage tester to confirm the power is off before touching the wires. The water heater is capable of heating nearly 4 gallons per minute in cold weather, or up to 6 gallons during summer months. When you replace a water heater, you are also expected to bring the water heating system up to current building codes While the cost of doing this is not directly part of the cost of the water heater, the two should be calculated together to find an estimate of the total expense.</p>

Higher installation cost: The upfront cost to install a new tankless water heater is more than a conventional storage tank system. These units, which heat water with thick copper rods, are quieter and about a third smaller than gas or propane tankless heaters.

<p>Fuel type (electric vs. gas)- Gas tankless water heaters are usually more expensive to install than electric water heaters, but cost less to operate on a monthly basis. Another major reason for people electing a tankless system is avoidance of the "shower frigid dance." If you have ever been halfway through a shower and had the hot water give out, you know what I mean. Considering the many advantages over traditional tank-type units, it isn't hard to see why homeowners love tankless systems.</p>
