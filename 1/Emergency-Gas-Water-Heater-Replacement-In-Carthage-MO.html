<p>Improve your home's water and energy consumption with a tankless water heater. Endless hot water: Because tankless water heaters produce hot water on demand, your supply never runs out. Gas hot water heaters have changed over the years as now most of them have a igniter for lighting the pilot and a gas valve with built in diagnostics. Many homes have galvanized steel or plastic (CPVC) water supply pipes. As time goes on, your water heater naturally starts to fill itself with sediment at the bottom of the tank.</p>
<p>Your water heater doesn't start up: A failure to ignite or to turn at all can indicate a number of problems with your water heater, from the thermostat to the electric ignition. Our Austin plumbers constantly receive calls from individuals who notice that their water heater might have a problem. If your electric water heater isn't working the first thing to do is check your breaker or fuse box. Furthermore, tankless systems last nearly twice as long as traditional water heaters - up to 20 years or more.</p>
