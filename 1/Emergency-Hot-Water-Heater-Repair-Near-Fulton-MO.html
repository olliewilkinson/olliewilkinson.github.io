<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it.

While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>
<p>The truth behind the myth is that the only part of the water heater which necessitates replacement is a leak in the tank itself.

This is absolutely crucial, and one of the most important reasons to consider professional water heater installation services in North Jersey. Another danger you should be aware is excessive pressure inside your water heater.
