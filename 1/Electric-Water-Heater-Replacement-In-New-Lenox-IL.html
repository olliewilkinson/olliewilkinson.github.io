Overall, tankless water heaters are about 85% efficient compared to conventional hot water tanks, which are about 60% efficient. Tank-type water heaters not only heat water but also store it in a tank until it's ready for use.</p>
<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there. If there is adequate electrical service and room in the breaker panel, electric tankless is a great option. The heating element in the unit heats it up to the temperature that is desired. Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>
<p>And while they cost more than electric-only models, installation is similar and payback time is short. The water heater replenishes supply following use of the stored hot water in the tank. Tankless coil and indirect water heaters - Indirect hot water heaters use the home's space heating system to heat water. Unlimited Hot Water: A traditional water heater will eventually run out of hot water and only work once the tank is refilled.</p>
