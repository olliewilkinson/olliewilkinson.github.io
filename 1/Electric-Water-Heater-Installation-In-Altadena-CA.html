<h3>Discover Why Plumbing Services Are Expensive Altadena CA</h3>
<p>Ultimately, you get the same amount of hot water in your shower or washing machine but use far less energy. Installation of a tankless water heater is NOT considered a "do-it-yourself" project. Michael Bonsby's plumbers are trained and certified so you can ensure you are getting professional installation service every time. California requires that all water heaters, including tankless, meet the state's minimum efficiency standards.</p>
<p>This includes inspecting the pressure relief valve, burner assembly, filters, anode rod and power supply that's heating the water. An electric water heater could easily short out, causing more damage to the heater or leave you in a dangerous situation. If your hot water heater is not working, it can be tough to go about your daily routine. These details are important and easy to get to. To find the capacity of the tankless hot water heater you need, you first have to find two numbers, which are plotted in a chart on the manufacture's site.</p>
<p>At Delk Plumbing, Inc., we only work with the best, ensuring you can enjoy long-term performance with lower energy costs. Best performance comes from gas units, as electric units are not Energy Star-rated. Many homeowners in our area are choosing to switch to a tankless water heater for many reasons. Homeowners are so attached to the idea of storage tanks when it comes to hot water that they find it a bit difficult to imagine how a tankless system might operate.</p>

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
<p>Take a look at your hot water heater's temperature gauge. Tankless water heaters are just as they sound. With our regular water heater repair and maintenance services, we can extend the life of your system, reduce the risk for water leaks, and improve the control over your water temperature. Having your TPR valve tested is also recommended as part of routine maintenance you should have done on your water heating unit.</p>

If there is currently no gas hookup at the house, and one has to be put in to facilitate the new tankless water heater, that will cost extra.</p>
<p>Similar to the video directly above, it also shows how to test the thermostat and elements, but it does a particularly good job of showing details such as the exact screws and terminals to test with a multimeter and how to use the multimeter. If a gas water heater is incorrectly vented, hot gases can present a fire danger inside the walls. Until, of course, the water heater suddenly stops working, and all that hot water that once flowed freely is nothing but a near-freezing stream — not something you're thrilled to take a shower in.</p>
<p>The non-condensing design uses a primary heat exchanger to heat water, which creates hot exhaust and the necessity to install an expensive vent.
