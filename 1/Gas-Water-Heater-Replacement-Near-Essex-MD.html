The power source for a tankless water heater needs to be readily accessible in the area where the tank is installed. Many people choose to simply use the same type that they are using presently, while others are influenced by the purchase price, the cost of running the heater over time, how energy efficient they are and how long it takes for the water to heat.</p>
<p>Prices vary depending on the option purchased, but the average price on these heaters is about $500. While you look for a unit, consider the following things: fuel types (gas or electric, unit type (tank or tankless), the length and coverage or warranty, how many people live in your home, long-term maintenance requirements, and operating costs.
