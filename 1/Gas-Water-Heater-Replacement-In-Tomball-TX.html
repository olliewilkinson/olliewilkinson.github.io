In addition, many state and local utilities offer rebates and incentives for converting to energy-saving appliances, which can help mitigate the cost of installing a tankless system. The payoff is big — you'll save up to 60% of the water heater part of your electric bill. If your water heater needs to be repaired periodically, then a decision to replace it needs to be taken. When the water on the top of the tank is hot, the top element turns off and the lower one heats.</p>
