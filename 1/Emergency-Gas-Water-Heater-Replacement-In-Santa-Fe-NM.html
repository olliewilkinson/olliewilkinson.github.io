<h2>Water Heater Services Santa Fe New Mexico</h2>
<p>Are you struggling with a broken water heater? Energy efficiency is a good starting point but there are other things we need to look at. Assuming that you are going to go with the more efficient tankless heater the most important pieces of information you need are the climate zone you live in, how many gallons of hot water you expect to use during the most demanding part of the day and how much you would pay for utilities, if you have a choice.</p>
<p>Our professional technicians have the experience and know-how to get even the toughest of heating and air repairs done with imperative results. Failure to do so can result in poor water heater performance, complete water heater failure, and even health issues.

The energy efficiency of water heaters is determined by the Energy Factor (EF) - a calculation of how much hot water the appliance produces versus how much fuel it consumes. If the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a new one, getting a new one is more economical.</p>
