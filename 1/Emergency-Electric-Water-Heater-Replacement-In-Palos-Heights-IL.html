<h2>Water Heater Services Palos Heights Illinois</h2>
<p>For both traditional and tankless water heaters, the thermostat is one of the most frequent culprits when it comes to malfunctions. Hold the hot water heater against the desired wall.

First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube. Southern California Gas Company offers a rebate of up to $200 on Energy Star-qualified tankless water heaters for models with an energy factor of 0.90 or higher and $150 rebate for models that meet a minimum energy factor of 0.82.

<p>That's because homes here are usually equipped for a standard, storage tank water heater. You are not afraid of running out of hot water again since they instantly heat water instead of warming a large bath tub or pool perhaps.

If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>

With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason. While tankless hot water heaters are generally more efficient than conventional water heaters, we can help you maintain your conventional water heater, or install a new conventional water heater, in a manner that will allow your conventional water heater to run just as efficiently as many tankless hot water heaters.</p>

Water heaters are an integral part of the plumbing systems in residential homes and commercial buildings. Heaters are used for not only space heating, but cooking, cleaning, and showering as well. Considering the benefit of a warranty replacement when the water heater is 4-5 years old with a 6 yr. warranty, the customer should really consider if this is a wise choice or if at that point, they should simply purchase a new water heater and obtain the full warranty protection of the new water heater.</p>
<p>Many of the points above can be found in the instruction manuals of tankless gas heaters. Heat pump water heaters, also called hybrid electric water heaters , capture heat from the air or ground and transfer it to the water. A tankless water heater doesn't store water and heats it only when you need it. There are natural gas, electricity, propane heaters for you to choose from and they store from 20 to 120 gallons of water, depending on the size of the tank.</p>
