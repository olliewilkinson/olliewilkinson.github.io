<h2>Water Heater Services Carlsbad California</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Our professional technicians have the experience and know-how to get even the toughest of heating and air repairs done with imperative results. Failure to do so can result in poor water heater performance, complete water heater failure, and even health issues. With a Rinnai® tankless water heater you'll enjoy the total confidence that comes with more than 30 years of innovation, support and integrity. A tankless water heater not only offer on-demand hot water, but this type of water heater comes in both electric and gas options.</p>
<p>The cold water will enter the tank, then the water will be heated and then the hot water will be stored until there will be demands coming from the bathroom shower or tap, or the dishwasher or kitchen sink. Solar water heaters: These water heaters use the power of the sun to heat water.

If these stops don't lead to hot water, it's time to either check the heating element in an electric water heater or the burner unit and gas control valve in a gas-powered heater.

Turn on the water on the hot side at a tub spout and bleed all the air out of the water heater and water lines. A fully installed water heater can cost up to $5,000. Hard water (meaning it has a higher mineral content) in San Diego and surrounding areas causes a scale buildup that can damage heating elements.</p>
