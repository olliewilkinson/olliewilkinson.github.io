<p>Relive the old days by learning how you can replace your own water heater for about $400 and a few hours of work. Our experts at Anthony Plumbing, the premier Plumber in Kansas City recommend replacing the heater before it starts displaying performance issues to save on heating costs. There will need to be two or three people to perform this stage, due to the size of the water heater and the height at which it will be mounted.</p>
<p>Tankless Water Heater Installations also typically require a flush kit to be installed for maintenance purposes. Replacing the anode rod regularly will significantly increase the life span of the water heater. Popular water heater brands are popular because of their reputation, and brands vary in price. Consequently, a tankless water heater is able to deliver as much instant hot water as you need and not a drop more.</p>
