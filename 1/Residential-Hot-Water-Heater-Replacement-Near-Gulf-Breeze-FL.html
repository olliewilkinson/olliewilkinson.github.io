Residential water heater repair is our most common type of job, so you can rest assured that all our technicians are experts at such repairs. The first kind works similarly to the hot rod in that an electric heating element heats the water. This then makes textiles, cloths, papers, and wood into potential fire hazards if left carelessly near the heating element of the heater.</p>
<p>Tank water heaters are the most common kind of water heater. After that, the new water heater can be brought in and maneuvered into place. When setting up a space heating water heating system you need a higher output quick recovery unit for some systems, like an electric forced hot air handler serviced by a hydronic heating coil. In the end, it is putting more pressure on the water heater to work. Our maintenance free heating units help water temperatures stay at safe levels.</p>

When a new water heater installation becomes the only option, you will have a couple of different options from which to choose, depending on the size of your home and how much hot water you use each day.

<p>It only heats water when you are calling for hot water and heats only in the amount that you need. Ninety degree bend on the top could be an obstacle for the venting, so it's good if there is much vertical rise at the top of the heater, as this allows the exhaust gas to easily emit out. Roto-Rooter plumbers are experts at water heater leak repair. However, if you're looking to make your home more energy efficient, our technicians may recommend replacing a less-efficient unit with one that heats better and uses less energy.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a tank heater only lasts about 10-12 years before having to be replaced, mostly because of corrosion inside the tank. Both these models are tankless and use natural gas, although you can also find models that use propane gas. Gas tankless water heaters are more expensive to install. Unlike the traditional tank water heater which is selected based on the capacity of the tank inside it, a tankless water heater will be chosen on its ability to service the demand during peak usage times throughout the day.</p>
<p>Not every house or business is going to use the same energy source to run their appliances, which is why it's so great that tankless water heaters can either be electric or gas. However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>
