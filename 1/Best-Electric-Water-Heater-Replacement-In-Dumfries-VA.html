<h2>Water Heater Services Dumfries Virginia</h2>
<p>Are you struggling with a broken water heater? Energy efficiency is a good starting point but there are other things we need to look at. Assuming that you are going to go with the more efficient tankless heater the most important pieces of information you need are the climate zone you live in, how many gallons of hot water you expect to use during the most demanding part of the day and how much you would pay for utilities, if you have a choice.</p>
<p>For a standard 40 gallon water heater you now only have about 34 gallons. The short delay between when the water starts to flow and when the heater kicks on causes a short burst of cold water before turning hot. Because methods for repairing the problem may depend on whether your water heater is gas or electric, these are discussed separately below. Electric Water Heater: For homes that are powered mainly by electricity, an electric water heater is likely the best option.</p>
<p>If you live in a warm or temperate climate, where the groundwater temperature is always above 55 degrees Fahrenheit, you will be able to run one main hot water fixture (a shower, bath, dishwasher, washing machine or kitchen sink), and a bathroom sink at the same time. While this is not something that people are too happy about, it is so important to get a replacement for your water heater when it is needed.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Dumfries</h3>
<p>Avoid ice cold showers and keep your water heater functioning properly. We have a variety of options for you including high-efficiency water heaters, electric water heaters, gas water heaters and tankless water heaters. Heaters produce heat, and that heat can cause a fire if not handled properly. Tankless water heaters provide hot water on demand, so regardless of household usage, you save money, energy and reduce waste by only heating water when you need it.</p>
<p>All hot water storage tanks include a critical safety feature: the temperature and pressure valve, which is often referred to as the T&P valve If the water gets too hot or the pressure in the tank is too high, the T&P valve will open and deposit water through a pipe running outside of the tank that usually ends 6 inches above the ground. The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>
<p>Gas-powered water heaters must vent out combustion fumes safely from the system. Unlike a storage tank water heater, which loses heat from the tank continually and must keep using energy to heat it up again, a tankless system only works when needed. After determining your fuel source, the next step is to decide if you are going to heat your water with electricity or natural gas.

No hot water - Check to see that your home and tank's water supply is uninterrupted, and the tank's power source is functioning (check the fuse box or gas burner unit, etc.). Try turning the unit off then back on again.</p>
