<h3>Professional Experience Is Essential For A Good Plumber Lancaster KY</h3>
<p>Older water heaters that use a tank can be quite large and take up a lot of space. The colder the incoming water the more heat the heater has to create. This can put a lot of strain on an average system, in such cases it could be wise to install more than one heater. The breakdown of your hot water heater can be from both preventable and unpreventable causes, such as a buildup of mineral scale, a disconnected gas or power supply, a problem with the temperature pressure release valve, and vent obstructions.</p>
<p>The water heater is a fairly simple appliance. When the distance between heater and fixture exceeds 50 feet, look for units with a built-in recirculation pump, which saves water and reduces waiting time. If your water heater is leaking contact us and we can assist you in shutting off the leaking water heater to help minimize any possible water damage. Tankless water heaters, on the other hand, do not store water.</p>
<p>These systems are also sometimes called on-demand water heaters because they only heat water when there is an immediate need for it. So there is no energy being wasted to maintain a tank of hot water that might not be used for hours, days, or even weeks if you are not at home. On the positive side, and despite the sticker-shock price tag, a tankless heater may be the best solution in a remote or infrequently used location.</p>

<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions. With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason. While tankless hot water heaters are generally more efficient than conventional water heaters, we can help you maintain your conventional water heater, or install a new conventional water heater, in a manner that will allow your conventional water heater to run just as efficiently as many tankless hot water heaters.</p>
<p>If you know the different types of water heaters available in the market, it is easier to make the right decision when purchasing one. Although a tankless water heater can cost more to install, many still consider it a worthwhile investment because tankless systems can last up to 20 years.

Most standard tankless water heaters have a lifespan of up to 20 years when properly maintained. Discolored water observed when hot water is coming out of your faucet, is a sign of excess scale built up inside your heater tank.</p>
<p>Thank you AC Plumbing Heating & Air for squeezing me in on a short notice to get my AC serviced. With a conventional water heater you are limited by the amount of hot water it holds. Rather than keeping a large tank of water warm around-the-clock until you need it, tankless water heaters rapidly heat the water you require right when you need it. This can save you, on average, over $80 in hot water costs each year.</p>
