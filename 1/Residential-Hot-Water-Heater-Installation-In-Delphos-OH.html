<p>It's important to keep a separate store of water on hand just in case the public water pipes are damaged, broken or if your public water supply becomes contaminated. If your water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. Instant water heaters have a lifespan of 15 to 18 years. There are numerous benefits to investing in professional water heater maintenance in Des Moines.</p>
<p>Installing a tankless hot water heater can be pricy. Fortunately, it can be easily remedied with a simple call to the experts at Valley Air Heating, Cooling & Plumbing. Identical water heaters don't always perform as well. In colder climates like ours with colder groundwater, smaller tankless water heaters will only deliver enough hot water for one shower at a time. Moreover, much of the heat produced by the pilot light of a tank-type model heats the water in the tank, heat that is just lost with the instantaneous units.</p>
<p>We recommend tankless units for smaller households or those looking to save space in their home. Whether your water heater is failing to produce anything but lukewarm water, has sprung a leak, or is simply outdated, Mr. Rooter Plumbing can help you find the perfect replacement for your home.

Prior to buying the hot & electric heaters you can even go through the online reviews. Something else to think about is if you can't upgrade to a larger conventional water heater because it may not fit. If you have limited space in your utility room or you like saving money on the energy bill and having consistent hot water, you need a tankless water heater installation estimate from AC Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning.</p>
