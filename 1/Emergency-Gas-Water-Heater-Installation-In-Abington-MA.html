<h2>Water Heater Services Abington Massachusetts</h2>
<p>A gas hot water heater is the most common type you will find in most households. The best way to prevent emergency water heater repairs is to schedule regular maintenance for your system. Long lasting - Traditional tank water heating systems generally come with a warranty of up to 6 years. Here, the water is heated using either a gas burner or electric element as it passes through. If you've had enough of waiting for your water tank to heat the water, there is the option of a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Tankless units have an average lifespan about twice that of conventional water heaters — 20 years or more. Call us today to schedule service for your water heater. One very good way of increasing the efficiency of your gas heater is by adding an insulation jacket.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Abington Massachusetts 02351</h3>
<p>Conventional tank water heaters: These water heaters are typically powered by natural gas or electricity. A unit can usually be installed in a day. We perform routine flushes as well as repairs to electric and gas tankless heaters. If you decide on a tankless water heater in Auburn, we'll help you get one that will serve you well and last for a long, long time. Start by turning off the propane and draining your water heater.</p>
<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
<p>If a gas line has to be added or relocated, then a plumbing permit may be required for the modifications or changes; note that just one permit may cover both the water heater and plumbing modifications. Persistent noises: Sometimes the tank makes noises because the heating element is burning out. Since PSE&G is not a Licensed Master Plumber, we use authorized licensed installers to provide the optional WorryFree Water Heater Replacement Service.</p>
<p>Gas water heater: Connect the gas line to the gas burner control valve. A conventional gas water heater is a tried-and-tested system designed to keep your home's hot water running. You can control the output temperature directly on the tankless water heater, so you know how hot the water is delivered to your taps will be. Tankless heaters have become popular due to their many benefits. They both use an insulated storage tank jacket made of steel, with insulation between the storage tank and the tank jacket to reduce heat loss of the heated water.</p>
<p>Electric tankless models may require an upgrade of the home's electrical capacity. These units also require tankless water heater replacement less frequently than traditional units. We can service the vast majority of water heater makes and models. The gas-fired type works very much the same as the electric heater in terms of sensing water flow and instantly heating it. But in this case, a propane burner heats the water.</p>
