<p>I need to purchase a new water heater SOON. Energy Saving: You'll notice the difference in your electricity bill since you don't have to heat up an entire tank of water. Your water heater's size is determined by how much warm water you use and what kind of heater you select. Other terms for Tankless are Combination, Combi Boilers, Continuous Flow, Inline, Flash, On-Demand or Instant-On Water heaters. Tankless water systems are popular for the simple reasons that tankless systems provide you with a virtually endless supply of hot water both where and when you need it. With old style tank systems, heated water can sit for long periods of time, generating hard-water scale and using costly energy to maintain water temperatures.</p>
