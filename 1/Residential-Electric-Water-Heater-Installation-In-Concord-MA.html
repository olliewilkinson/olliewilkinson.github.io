Tankless water heaters can be powered by both gas and electricity. If you have a gas water heater, turn off the gas shutoff valve in the supply line, too, before disconnecting it. If your gas water heater has a fan unit, unplug it. If your water heater's electric, unplug it. If there's a cable connection, switch off the power first, then disconnect the cable.</p>

Noise - water heaters collect mineral deposits and sediment on the heating elements, just at the bottom of the tank. Enjoy having steady hot water again and call Trusted Plumbing.
