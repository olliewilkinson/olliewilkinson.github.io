<h2>Water Heater Services Greenwood South Carolina</h2>
<p>Water heaters are so many and of various makes and designs that at times it might be difficult to decide on a particular make to buy for your home. This signifies that the water heater is starting to rust, and in most cases is going to need to be replaced before it completely floods the floor. Also, they cannot be located outside your home like tankless water heaters. Thermocouple Problems: This safety device is an essential part of your gas water heater.

<p>Whether you are looking for a water heating system for your new home or your current system has seen better days and needs a replacement, one of the first things you need to do is to look at all of your available options and weigh their pros and cons. How many GPM a tankless heater can deliver is entirely dependent on how much energy (either electric or gas) the unit has available to heat the water. These types of water heaters are able to last 20 years, whereas tank water heaters last 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>Check the main switch on the water heater and the circuit breaker (or fuse) that serves the water heater. A tankless water heater is more expensive than its traditional counterpart. The only problem I found with it, which I later discovered that it is common to all brands of this water heaters is that the installation can be expensive, since you may need upgrades to pipes and additional electrical work. In addition, water in a tank has to be heated hotter than necessary to account for these stand-by losses.</p>
<p>AC Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning can identify and repair any hot water issue in your home or office building. When a new water heater is needed, most people hire a technician or plumbing company for installation to handle the job. Different electric heaters have very different wire configurations and colorations, so to prevent damage to your heater's circuitry and to prevent electrocuting yourself, consider calling an electrician or electrical inspector to check your work or connect the wires for you.</p>

<p>A 50 gallon water heater can take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours for electric or 30 to 60 minutes for gas to heat water to 120 degrees. It really depends on the brand you buy, and the cost of the model purchased, but a traditional water heater will last 10 to 13 years, and a tankless water heater will generally last up to 20 years. If the circuit breaker or fuse repeatedly blows out, call a qualified electrician to check and repair the circuit.</p>
<p>As a water heater ages, sediment will build up on the bottom of the tank. When having an electric tankless water heater installed by a professional, be aware of the electrical service requirements, the additional wires needed for installation, and your home's climate. Pick up the water heater and hang it on the slots. Electric tankless heaters are 99 percent efficient. One other thing you can do when you install or service a water heater to make your life easier is to go ahead and replace the cheesy, plastic drain valve.</p>
<p>With a Rinnai tankless hot water heater, you can expect to have up to 9.8 gallons of hot water per minute. At the same time, they provide reliable hot water that never runs out. The company's tank water heaters are available exclusively at Home Depot. There are usually two heating elements inside the storage tank, one located near the bottom and one located in the middle of the tank. Tankless water heaters last 15 to 20 years.</p>

<p>Initial Cost - Tank heaters are cheaper to purchase and typically less expensive to install. However, f you use more hot water daily (around 86 gallons or more), then you may only get to enjoy an additional 8-10% energy efficiency. With sediment piling up on the bottom of your tank, your water heater is trying to heat water through the mound of dirt, leading to a longer wait time for your water to heat. If your water heater malfunctions, the first step is to turn off both the power and water supply to the water heater to prevent further damage.</p>
<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>
<p>If not give Haven Heating and Air Conditioning a call today to join our maintenance plan and have peace of mind that if there's an issue with your tankless water heater, we will be there to take care of it. Tank water heaters are the most common type of water heater. Therefore, they avoid the standby heat losses associated with storage water heaters. A water heater is a complex machine and one that is placed under a lot of stress during operation.</p>
<p>It will also take a long time for the water you need to heat up, since it only starts to do so when you turn on a tap. While the water heater is filling up leave the faucets on so you can bleed all of the air out of the system. The main companies producing such heaters are Bosch, Rheum and Noritz. Tankless water heaters generally require a higher initial investment, but they are less costly to operate and provide additional benefits like endless hot water.</p>
<p>Use channel-type pliers or a pipe wrench to loosen and disconnect the lines from the water heater. Over time, water heaters often suffer from sediment build-up that can damage the tank. For example, a sudden loss of hot water may mean that the pilot has gone out. Be sure to connect the cold water pipe to the cold water inlet on the water heater. Cold water enters the tank and is heated by an electric element or gas burner.</p>
