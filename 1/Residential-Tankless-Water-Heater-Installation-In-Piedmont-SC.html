<h2>Water Heater Services Piedmont South Carolina</h2>
<p>Tankless water heaters, both gas and electric, are pretty much in demand these days, as they are considered to be one of the most energy efficient appliances available today. Gas-fired tankless water heaters produce higher flow rates than electric ones. Some popular models include Bosch Aquastar 2400ES Gas Tankless Water Heater, GE Indoor Tankless Gas Water Heater Model GN94DNSRSA and Rheem Tankless Water Heater RTG-74PVN-1, Indoor Use. Water Heater- Install what you are taking out if you have a 40 gallon and want to upgrade to a 50 gallon now is the time to do it. If you do have a 50 gallon I DO NOT recommend switching to anything lower than what you have.</p>
<p>The innovative changes in gas valve function to heater designs alone are unequaled. We recommend talking to a licensed professional before making the final decision on a water heater purchase. If your water heater is at least 10 years old, it may be time for an upgrade. For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time can stretch a tankless water heater to its limit. Energy savings, endless supply of hot water, low operating cost, reduced risk of power problems, space savings and durability, and safety and assurance are the other advantages.</p>
<p>Hot water tanks typically last an average of 10 years, with variables like the condition of your water supply and frequency of preventative maintenance playing significant roles in your system's useful life. A water heater that's right for you. Connect with dedicated hoses the hot water outlet and the cold water inlet via the pressure relief valve. While your choice of water heater will cause a greater or lesser upfront cost, over time this will all average out to where you end up paying about the same over five years.</p>
<h3>Affordable Hot Water Heater Replacement Piedmont</h3>
<p>A hot water heater is the thirty to fifty gallon tank tactfully closeted in your kitchen, bathroom, or some other well-concealed space. In water heater tanks, one of the most common problems is corrosion. Hot water heaters work hard day in, day out — until they don't. Only heats water when you need it, so energy isn't wasted for hot water that's not needed right away. Many people try to cut water usage in an effort to reduce this lost energy, but they don't realize that the heat is still generated throughout the day, whether or not they actually use the hot water in the tank.</p>
<p>The new Federal Water Heater Energy Standards have produced a burst of energy in new water heater design and technology Here's a cool Infographic from the U.S. Department of Energy. Because tankless water heaters are a compact size, they don't take up a lot of space. They save energy (and save you money), they provide unlimited hot water, they're small and compact, they never leak and don't contribute to harmful metals in your water.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are energy efficient compared to traditional water heating systems, as they do not work until a hot water faucet is turned on. Regular maintenance can keep your tankless unit going up to 20 years — twice as long as standard storage water heaters. That's because of their reputation for running more efficiently, an appealing characteristic given that heating water is the average U.S. home's second highest utility cost after heating and cooling the house itself.</p>
<p>Commercial water heater Las Vegas sic takes the trouble out of troubleshooting. To fix this, purchase a new anode rod, replace, and flush your water heater completely before using it. The instructions on lighting the pilot are often hidden on the front of the water heater. Making sure your demand for hot water doesn't exceed the capacity of your heater - If you need more hot water than it can produce, try changing your water usage habits.</p>
<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Piedmont SC</h3>
<p>This is especially true for those units that have gone without proper maintenance or repairs when needed. That's 2X the life of a traditional hot water heater. When long-term costs matter, the electric tankless water heater is the most cost-effective option, but is not the most efficient fuel source. Gas or electric demand units average about the same cost to purchase. Each type of water heater has their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Most modern tankless water heaters operate in the range of 11,000 to 199,000 BTUs per hour. If you're planning to sell your home in the near future, and you fear your existing water heater may not last, I would consider the lower upfront cost of a conventional one, or at most upgrade (for the improved marketability) to the high-efficiency gas storage water heater, rather than incurring the additional expense of a whole-home tankless gas water heater.</p>
<p>A water heater is an item that most homeowners don't think about daily. We'll answer all your questions and provide the information you need to decide if a tankless heater fits your needs. The major difference between the two types is that the flow controlled type works only with cold water while the thermostatic type can function with hot or cold water. Tankless water heaters heat water directly without the use of a storage tank.</p>

A tankless water heater doesn't store water and heats it only when you need it.
