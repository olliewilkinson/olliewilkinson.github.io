Many of today's tankless water heater models are wi-fi compatible and can be monitored with a smart phone.

They do require a storage tank, unlike conventional tankless water heaters, but because an indirect heater uses the boiler or main furnace to heat the fluid circulated through a heat exchanger in the storage tank, the energy that's actually "stored" by the tank lets the furnace turn off and on less frequently.</p>
<p>Type: Traditional water heaters tend to be most common. With all the choices on the market; tank or tankless, gas or electric, number of gallons, etc., your options may seem overwhelming.

It is not necessary to wrap Teflon tape or to apply pipe dope on threads of the new element(s) unless the new element specifies the use of it (especially if the replacement element has a gasket). We offer service in traditional gas and electric water heaters.</p>
