<h2>Water Heater Services San Jose California</h2>
<p>While the process of installing a tankless water heater isn't too difficult it is very different from the process of installing a standard tank water heater. Choosing the right team of plumbing professionals to maintain the flow of hot water to your home or business can be a challenging and stressful decision, which is why we're proud to have been the go-to professionals for many homes and businesses in High Point, NC since 1997. Electric water heater: Confirm that the circuit is off to the water heater, using a non-contact voltage tester, then disconnect the wiring connections and circuit cable from the water heater.</p>
<p>If a water heater is installed without a T&P valve (temperature and pressure relief valve) it may explode. Tankless water heaters are not measured on the capacity of water they hold but on how many gallons of hot water they can produce per minute. There are three main reasons why your electric heater might not be producing hot water. There are different brand names of tankless water heaters to choose from since this kind of home appliances is in demand in the market with different designs, sizes and features.</p>
<p>The truth behind the myth is that the only part of the water heater which necessitates replacement is a leak in the tank itself. Another sort of water heater pumps the heat around the plumbing system, while an indirect water heater heats the water through the house's general heating system. No matter your reason for choosing a tankless version, you can rest assured that our fully licensed contractors have the knowledge, skills, and resources to complete your tankless water heater installation quickly and efficiently.</p>
<h3>Local Hot Water Heater Repair San Jose</h3>
<p>This may be an old resistive type heater and should be replaced by more modern heaters that can be up to 5 times more efficient at heating water. Savings: Unlike traditional water heaters, tankless units only heat water as it is needed, which results in extra energy savings per month. Although gas tankless water heaters are clearly more efficient than their storage tank cousins, their efficiency normally tops out at 80-85%.</p>
<p>If the valve didn't work, then the water heater needs to be replaced. Step 3. Turn off the water to the water heater or if the valve is not working turn off the water to the house. Electric tankless water heaters provide continuous hot water when sized appropriately, producing and maintaining hot water throughout your home or business as needed. Replacing an old hot water heater with the same type in the same spot will minimise the hot water system installation cost to as low as $250.</p>
<p>Our Superior technicians will perform a capacity test” to identify the ideal tank size for your needs, giving you the best First Hour Rating (FHR) to meet your peak hot water needs without excess cost. Whole house tankless heaters are installed near an exterior wall in order to reach the vent for gas units, but have some flexibility in placement. This is where AirPlus Heating & Cooling can help to resolve your issues with a new water heater installation or repair.</p>
<p>Innovative technology provides an endless supply of hot water whenever and wherever it's needed. Let us help you decide on the best water heater for your home, lifestyle, and budget. We are also happy to install a tankless water heater or upgrade your current heater. Installing solar water heaters may seem expensive to you at first, but really the installation is very cost effective-as it pays for itself over a matter of a couple years.</p>
<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 San Jose CA</h3>
<p>Water heaters are heavy - use a helper, appliance dolly or hand truck when moving the appliance. Next, touch the water heater's temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve and the hot water outlet pipe above the water heater (see water heater diagrams above ). Some electric water heater problems may be more serious, however. If only the hot water is discolored or smelly, it's because there's a high concentration of sulfates or other minerals in your tank.</p>
<p>When you turn on a hot water tap in your home, either a gas burner or an electric element directly heats the cold water that travels through a pipe into the unit. One of the best plumbing appliances that we have in our homes and businesses is the water heater. VENTING: Noncondensing tankless gas heaters use stainless-steel vents that can withstand high exhaust heat. Here are a few hot water tank brands we carry and install on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Lower temperatures have also been proven to make your tankless gas water heater last longer because less minerals and corrosion will build up. Consider insulating your water heater pipes as well, especially if the water is traveling three feet or more from the unit's location. The approach is consistent for tankless water heaters. Many manufacturer's and plumbers recommend that a water softener is installed when you have a tankless water heater.</p>

<p>2. You can decide to replace it when you get discolored or tainted water when you turn on the hot tap. For homes with high daily water demands, multiple tankless heaters can be installed. Also, since tank-style heaters have been around longer and are more common, more professionals are capable of installing them and the labor costs are lower. If you think you might have a shower, washing machine, and kitchen sink going at the same time, you'll need a unit that can supply 6 GPM (2.5 + 2.0 + 1.5 = 6.0 GPM).</p>
<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
<p>In your specific case, this may require a larger gas line or a much larger electric supply than what is currently running to your water heater location. Only gas can produce enough hot water for a large home. Contact us anytime you think your water heater needs repair service. If you're not getting hot water, it could be the heating element or another maintenance issue. Whether you have a gas, propane, or electric water heater, there might be times when you wish you had more hot water to work with.</p>
<p>You'll also need assistance because water heaters are heavy and bulky, making them difficult to handle. With a tankless unit in place, you can rest assured knowing the system will provide clean and fresh water to your faucets. Most standard tankless water heaters have a lifespan of up to 20 years when properly maintained. Discolored water observed when hot water is coming out of your faucet, is a sign of excess scale built up inside your heater tank.</p>
<p>If your water heater is malfunctioning, give Assured Comfort a call. Providing nearly twice the service life and exceptional efficiency, tankless water heating adds value to the home. You need to be extra careful when you are handling gas, even though it is safe once it is installed, it has the ability to cause quite an amount of damage if not handled in a proper manner. In many cases a professional plumber can have a water heater repaired in 2 to 3 hours, but this can vary depending on the problem.</p>
