These types of water heaters are able to last 20 years, whereas tank water heaters last 10 to 15 years.</p>

It is important to ensure you chose a model rated to the expected needs of your family, but these models often provide significantly more reliable hot water delivery than tank models.</p>
<p>Not every house or business is going to use the same energy source to run their appliances, which is why it's so great that tankless water heaters can either be electric or gas. However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>
