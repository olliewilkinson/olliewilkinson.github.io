<h2>Water Heater Services Leesburg Georgia</h2>
<p>Installing a tankless gas water heater is a very worthwhile investment and one that will pay for itself in a very short period of time. Without a warranty, you could end up spending a lot more on repairs of an old water heater than you would if you upgraded to a new model. Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed. However, you also have to decide between these three tankless water venting systems: a direct vent system, a non-direct vent system, or an outdoor tankless system.</p>
<p>The innovative changes in gas valve function to heater designs alone are unequaled. We recommend talking to a licensed professional before making the final decision on a water heater purchase. If your water heater is at least 10 years old, it may be time for an upgrade. For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time can stretch a tankless water heater to its limit. Energy savings, endless supply of hot water, low operating cost, reduced risk of power problems, space savings and durability, and safety and assurance are the other advantages.</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing. If the water is still as hot as it was before you turned the temperature down, it's because the thermostat isn't working. That's why it's important to regularly maintain and, if necessary, repair your hot water tank — and that's a task that AirPlus Heating & Cooling can assist you with. It is important to know what you have as well as the benefits and disadvantages to making water heater changes, which is why our friendly technicians are here to help.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Leesburg Georgia 31763</h3>
<p>If you need professional water heater installation or replacement, you have come to the right place. Also, test all wires in the water heater with a non-contact voltage tester to confirm the power is off before touching the wires. The water heater is capable of heating nearly 4 gallons per minute in cold weather, or up to 6 gallons during summer months. When you replace a water heater, you are also expected to bring the water heating system up to current building codes While the cost of doing this is not directly part of the cost of the water heater, the two should be calculated together to find an estimate of the total expense.</p>
<p>But … tankless water heaters may still encounter repair needs that will require calling on a professional plumber. Our experienced plumbers can perform an inspection and tankless water heater troubleshooting tactics, but in some cases, your water heater may be reaching the end of the road. Aside from this feature, tankless water heaters have low maintenance and running costs. These systems are also called on demand” and instant” water heaters because they heat water which enters your home through your plumbing system instantly.</p>
<p>The process of heating the water is triggered when the tankless hot water heater senses the demand for hot water, which occurs when you turn on the hot water tap. In this case, the expanding water flows into the expansion tank rather than your pipes. Removal of a water heater requires the power source to be disconnected and the tank to be completely drained. Our energy saver installation service saves you time and energy.</p>
<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there. If there is adequate electrical service and room in the breaker panel, electric tankless is a great option. The heating element in the unit heats it up to the temperature that is desired. Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>
<p>Many of the points above can be found in the instruction manuals of tankless gas heaters. Heat pump water heaters, also called hybrid electric water heaters , capture heat from the air or ground and transfer it to the water. A tankless water heater doesn't store water and heats it only when you need it. There are natural gas, electricity, propane heaters for you to choose from and they store from 20 to 120 gallons of water, depending on the size of the tank.</p>
