You'll need to have the water heater cleaned out, but we also strongly recommend installing a water softener to eliminate the problem at the source.

In this tank, cold water is used to fill the tank, and an element, usually near the top & bottom inside the tank is used to heat it. In between the inside tank and the outer shell is often insulation to help keep the water hot, without the elements having to do all of the work.
