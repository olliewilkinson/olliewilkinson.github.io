Hot water system installation cost depends on your plumber. ClimateCare members are trained to repair every make and model of water heater, and update their training when new technologies enter the market.</p>
<p>These systems are also sometimes called on-demand water heaters because they only heat water when there is an immediate need for it. So there is no energy being wasted to maintain a tank of hot water that might not be used for hours, days, or even weeks if you are not at home. On the positive side, and despite the sticker-shock price tag, a tankless heater may be the best solution in a remote or infrequently used location.</p>
