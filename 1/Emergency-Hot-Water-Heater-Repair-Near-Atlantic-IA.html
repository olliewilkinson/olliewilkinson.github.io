<h2>Water Heater Services Atlantic Iowa</h2>
<p>When it comes to do it yourself projects around the house, you can save a bundle of money over having someone else do the work for you. Tankless water heaters provide hot water right when you need it. By heating cold water directly, you don't have to wait for hot water to fill the tank. Tankless water heaters are rated to produce specific levels of heat. When you encounter a problem with your water heater, you aren't able to do any of these things, and that's a major disruption to your life. Payback time was longer for a tankless unit that replaced an existing storage tank but more reasonable with new construction.</p>
<p>Since a tankless unit only runs when hot water is being used, it can be left on with no waste or risk and no worries.

Similar to gas-fired tank-type systems, gas-fired tankless systems include a vent that removes any by-products created during the combustion process. Typically, tankless water heaters provide hot water at a rate of 2-5 gallons (7.6-15.2 liters) per minute. If your electric hot water heater is slow to heat, runs out of hot water faster than it used to, or doesn't deliver any hot water at all, there's a 90 percent chance that simply replacing one or both of the heating elements will solve the problem.</p>
