<p>Most water heaters cannot last for a lifetime. Tankless water heaters are gaining popularity with homeowners in Scottsdale, AZ. At Affordable Plumbing, Rooter and Water Heaters, we specialize in providing homeowners efficient options for their water heating needs. Unlike conventional water heaters, which may hold 40 to 50 gallons of hot water ready at all times, tankless water heaters save energy by producing hot water only when needed. Replacement or installation of shutoff valves for water and gas.</p>
<p>If you currently have a gas system then purchase a tankless water heater system that also operates on gas. Plumbing-supply stores, big-box stores, and online retailers all carry these heaters.
