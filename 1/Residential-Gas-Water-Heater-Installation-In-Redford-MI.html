<h2>Water Heater Services Redford Michigan</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>Cleaner water - A tankless unit provides cleaner water too. Energy conservation is a great feature of on-demand tankless water heaters, but it's not the only great feature. Whether you're showering, washing clothing, doing dishes, or just brewing coffee, it's important to have access to hot water when you want it. We care about your home's plumbing system and want to make sure your water heater is running properly.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the type of traditional hot water tank you had, you may be able to install it in the same area. In addition to high upfront costs, smaller tankless units don't always deliver enough hot water to appliances and showers simultaneously. Our 24-hour emergency plumbers offer a complete range of solutions that can get a faulty system back up and running in no time. Many homeowners are interested in how tankless water heaters can save them money, since these units are more energy efficient than their tank counterparts.</p>

TML Service Experts has expertise to fix your water heater and have your household back to normal. A tankless gas water heater lasts around 20 years, while a traditional gas water heater lasts about 15. New systems are often more reliable as well, so you won't have to worry about running out of hot water at inconvenient times.</p>
<p>If you live in a multi-person household, compare tankless models, paying particular attention to the gallons per minute (GPM) flow of each model. Even when there is no demand, the water must be reheated every time the temperature falls below the thermostat threshold. When the stored water cools due to standby heat loss, a thermostat in the tank triggers the reheating process. And because the heat pump is on top, a hybrid water heater needs as much as 7 feet of clearance from floor to ceiling.</p>

And no one wants to pay for an exorbitant electric bill for hot water never used. Many jurisdictions consider new water heater installation and replacement water heater installation a different type of job (i.e., a permit may be required for one, but not the other).
