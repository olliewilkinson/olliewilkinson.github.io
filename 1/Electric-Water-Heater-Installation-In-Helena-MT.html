<p>Buyers must also have realistic expectations regarding the performance of the tankless water heater they intend to buy.

<p>Overall, there are situations where a hot water tank is a better choice over a tankless water heater. Vents also need to be installed to ventilate the unit. Low maintenance: With no storage tank to drain, clean, and protect from corrosion, tankless water heaters require less maintenance, and may last longer than traditional storage-tank water heating equipment. Tankless water heater built with condensing technology has lower costs of installation.</p>
<p>Portable water heaters are good choices for adding hot water to out buildings, shops or garages. Turn on a faucet in a nearby room to hot and listen for the heater to turn on. Then, look at every joint on the heater to make sure there is no leakages. However, the process is very easy with a tankless gas water heater. Whether you use a traditional or a tankless water heater, you need to keep an eye out for mineral buildup inside your water heater.</p>

Replacing the anode rod regularly will significantly increase the life span of the water heater. Popular water heater brands are popular because of their reputation, and brands vary in price. Consequently, a tankless water heater is able to deliver as much instant hot water as you need and not a drop more.</p>
