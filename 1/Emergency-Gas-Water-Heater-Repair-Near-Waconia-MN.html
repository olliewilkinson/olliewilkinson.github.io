Because of their high-powered burners, tankless heaters need to be installed in a well-vented space for safe operation. They repeatedly heat water so hot water is always ready. Water heaters are fired by gas or electricity. Water leaks and gas leaks can be fixed by tightening the connections or soldering the pipes. Tankless water heaters also have limited output.

<p>The average tankless water heater repair costs $603. A traditional water heater will last up to 10-15 years in your home before it begins to lose efficiency. It's also important to clean out the sediment filter on the heater from time to time. Large households consume a lot of hot water, especially at peak times in the mornings and evenings.

<p>That's because homes here are usually equipped for a standard, storage tank water heater. You are not afraid of running out of hot water again since they instantly heat water instead of warming a large bath tub or pool perhaps. One solution to the long wait is to install a small tank water heater after the tankless water heater to act as a tempering tank, but once you do that, it's no longer a truly tankless system.</p>
