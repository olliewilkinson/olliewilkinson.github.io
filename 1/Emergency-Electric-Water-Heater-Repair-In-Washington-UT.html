Tankless water heaters for RVs are becoming increasingly popular specifically for this. I was impressed the first time that I saw a tankless water heater.

<p>If you are operating a shower at 2.5 GPM and a dishwasher at 2 GPM during peak usage, you home would require a whole-home tankless gas water heater that is rated for minimum of 4.5 GPM at a 65° F temperature rise. When it's near the points of use, the time taken by the hot water to travel from the heater to the fixture will reduce. We offer water heater repair services throughout the Orange County area.

<p>Like their name implies, these compact units heat your water without the use of a cumbersome tank that takes up space in your utility room or basement. Although uncommon, issues can arise if something isn't working correctly within your water heater. Iinstead of waiting until your heater breaks, you should plan (now, while the water is hot!) for your water heater's replacement. Sometimes, however, even the largest, gas-fired model cannot supply enough hot water for simultaneous, multiple uses in large households.</p>
<p>There are leaks at the base of the water heater tank. Use pipe that is rated for hot water such as copper or CPVC. Under no circumstances do working water heaters need to be replaced.

Tank water heaters store water and heat it on demand, while tankless water heaters heat the water using coils, without storing it. Tank water heaters are generally less expensive and can accommodate high-demand households, while tankless are more expensive up front, but can reduce your energy usage by around 30 per cent.</p>
