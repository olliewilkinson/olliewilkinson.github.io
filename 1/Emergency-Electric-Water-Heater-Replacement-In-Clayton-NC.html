<p>This system is also known as "demand water heaters" as they provide hot water only when needed.

<p>Most DIYers try to make their own water heater repairs in an effort to save money. A tankless water heater installation really isn't all that complicated and there aren't too many parts that have to be purchased. Gas is more energy efficient and cheaper to run, but electric will not make a drastic difference. Tankless Water Heaters have become a really hot commodity in the last couple of years (I know, that was a really bad pun).</p>
<p>In the one tank system, the solar storage and the backup heater are all part of the same unit, and in the two-tank system, the solar component in the system heats the water before it is fed through to the water heater.

<p>Tankless water heaters, also referred to as on-demand water heaters, produce hot water only when you want it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when added to homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water every day, according to They also last about double the amount of time as long as a tank water heater.

Although gas and electric water heaters can lose some efficiency because water is constantly being heated in the tank, current efficiency standards are much improved over the past. Most water heaters are gas, so even the smallest of mistakes made during installation can cause added expenses, property damage, injury, or even death.</p>
<p>Electric units face even bigger changes. A tankless heater is not effective when more than two tasks are drawing from it. So it should be one at a time. This valve is supposed to shut off the water heater's heating element once the water reaches a certain pressure.

<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
