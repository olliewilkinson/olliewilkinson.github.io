<h2>Water Heater Services Cortez Colorado</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>Other water heater brands currently on the market include: Bradford White, EcoSmart, Rinnai, and State.
