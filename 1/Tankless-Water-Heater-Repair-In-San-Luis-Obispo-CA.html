Leaks - If you're finding water around the base of your hot water tank, then your water heater has most likely already corroded beyond the ability for a repair. It's Making Noise - As your water heats, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. Some of them have the anode installed in a separate opening on top of the tank and some use a combination anode rod that is installed in the hot water outlet of the tank.</p>

Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
