Tankless water heaters work in almost any environment when mounted inside or outside your home or business. A water heater expansion tank costs $40 to $200 with labor adding another $50 to $150.</p>
<p>Determining whether you should repair your water heater or purchase a new one depends solely on what is wrong with it in the first place. They know from experience which models of heaters tend to hold up the best to the hard water. Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity. Tankless systems heat water by activating a set of coils that become hot when the unit is turned on. As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are installed near the point of use, or place where the hot water is needed. A tank style heater stores a specific amount of water, keeping it heated at the temperature you choose, sending it along when you turn on the hot water faucet. If you have a gas power heater, you have to install it about eighteen inches off the ground. When considering a tankless water heating system, one major thing to look into is the kind of fuel you want to use for heating.</p>
