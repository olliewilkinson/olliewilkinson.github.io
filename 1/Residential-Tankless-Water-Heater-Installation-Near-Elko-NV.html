<h2>Water Heater Services Elko Nevada</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call.

Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>
<p>And obviously, tankless water heaters take up much less space than the hulking behemoth of an old fashioned storage water heater.

Environmentally Friendly: Improved efficiency also leads to a reduced carbon footprint, making a tankless water heater installation a great move to make your home greener.</p>
