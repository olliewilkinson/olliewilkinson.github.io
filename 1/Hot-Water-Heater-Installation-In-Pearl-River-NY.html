<p>Buying a tankless gas water heater is quite an investment, so being able to install it yourself will help reduce some of the price. Remember that online and in person salespeople are typically not water heating professionals. If line voltage is found, wait for water to heat or perform the Ohms (or Resistance) checks on the elements once more with the power off. Enjoy hot water more regularly during the day, without worrying about the utility bill going up. With a proper-sized system on your home, you should notice the hot water heater running much less often—and you should see a reduction on your next utility bill, too.</p>
