A properly installed tankless heater can certainly save a large amount of energy over a traditional water heater. A cold shower is a sure sign that your Gwinn home needs water heater maintenance.</p>
<p>As with many household devices, water heaters become more expensive to maintain as they get older. For this reason, you need a repair expert who is experienced in handling tankless style heaters, and that's exactly what HomeWorks water heater repair technicians can offer you. Whereas your normal tank for replacement can be had anywhere from $150 to over $1000, plus installation costs of $200 to $400, an instant model will run from about $400 - $3000 with additional costs for installation, particularly if the supply lines and venting options for gas are not adequate.</p>
<p>Apply heat-resistant silicone sealant to the vent shaft of the water heater, slip on a connector and secure with a hose clamp. Circuit wiring is usually housed in flexible metal cable or conduit where it connects to the water heater. So if the tank you use is well insulated and the boiler you use is highly efficient, this can be the least expensive way to provide hot water for a home's occupants. Using a natural gas rate of $10.86 per 1,000 cubic feet, we calculated that the payback time for converting from a storage tank gas water heater to a gas tankless ranges from 22½ years to 27½ years.</p>
