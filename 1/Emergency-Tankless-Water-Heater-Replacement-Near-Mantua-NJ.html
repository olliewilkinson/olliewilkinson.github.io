There may be issues with the gas metering and appropriate gas pressures to your heater. Propane is also a good choice for those looking to save on energy costs.</p>
<p>For instance, for a home with two stories and a basement, the worst place to install the heater is in the basement. However if you find that you have no hot water with an electric tank it would be a good idea to check your breaker to see if the breaker has tripped. A broken or deteriorated dip tube can cause the cold water to stay near the top, making your water heater unable to heat the water properly.

<p>Fuel type (electric vs. gas)- Gas tankless water heaters are usually more expensive to install than electric water heaters, but cost less to operate on a monthly basis.
