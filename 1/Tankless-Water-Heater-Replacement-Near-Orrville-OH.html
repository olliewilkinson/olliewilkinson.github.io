<h2>Water Heater Services Orrville Ohio</h2>
<p>When it comes to a clean burning fuel source to supply your hot water requirements as well as a quick recovery time, a natural gas water heater can certainly take care of your needs. Their line of AquaStar tankless water heaters continue to set the standard with an efficiency range of 80% - 87%. So long as all is well, you should have hot water in no time. One drawback to electric units is its limited output, which tops out at 36 kilowatts, or about 123,000 Btus. When you're interested in installing a tankless water heater, we come to your home, inspect your plumbing system, and lay out a road map for exactly how your installation will work.</p>
<p>The tankless water heater must be able to deliver this maximum flow rate at the desired temperature rise. With the amount of money you'll save on energy costs, reduced maintenance requirements, and longer-lasting nature of these systems, you'll enjoy safer and more reliable warm water for longer, which keeps more money in your pocket where it belongs. For instance, less natural resources go into the manufacturing of these compact size heaters.</p>

By some estimates, a tankless hot water heater uses 22% less energy than its traditional counterpart. Whether you are in of water heater repairs or you're interested in upgrading to a newer, more efficient tankless model, our expert plumbing technicians can help. Check the Energy Factor (EF) to see how efficient the unit is. A higher EF rating indicates better efficiency.</p>

The right water heater can keep your baths and showers comfortable, your dishes clean, and your clothes washed—all at a temperature that works best for the soaps you're using.</p>
<p>Water underneath the water heater is almost always a sure sign that your water heater needs replacing. Raise the gas burner or the lower heating element on an electric water heater at least eighteen inches above the floor if the equipment is in the garage. In large homes however, you might need more than one for a proper supply of hot water. Generally residential water heaters have a life expectancy of 8-12 years.</p>
<p>Electric tankless units can potentially help you save on home energy use and provide continuous hot water on demand. Leaks - If you're finding water around the base of your hot water tank, then your water heater has most likely already corroded beyond the ability for a repair.

Some of them have the anode installed in a separate opening on top of the tank and some use a combination anode rod that is installed in the hot water outlet of the tank.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Orrville Ohio 44667</h3>
<p>Like their name implies, these compact units heat your water without the use of a cumbersome tank that takes up space in your utility room or basement. Although uncommon, issues can arise if something isn't working correctly within your water heater. Iinstead of waiting until your heater breaks, you should plan (now, while the water is hot!) for your water heater's replacement. Sometimes, however, even the largest, gas-fired model cannot supply enough hot water for simultaneous, multiple uses in large households.</p>
<p>If you're having problems with your existing water heater—or you need to get a new one—don't try to deal with it alone. Our trained technicians will restore your hot water in no time at all, so that you aren't left wondering where you will take your next shower.
