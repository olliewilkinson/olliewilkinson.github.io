<h2>Water Heater Services Boyne City Michigan</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>
<p>Solar water heaters use a storage tank that keeps water heated by the sun. For thread-in-type elements like we show here, you'll need a water heater element wrench ($5 at home centers and hardware stores). Tankless water heaters are different in their rating system—they are sold according to the demand they can meet, the flow rate, and are measured in gallons per minute (GPM). If you're running out of hot water too quickly, there are a couple things to check.</p>
<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Repair Boyne City</h3>
<p>Here at Beehive Plumbing we have experience with all types of gas water heaters. Tankless units can only supply a few gallons of hot water at a time. Talk to your plumbing service technician about the cost of the required repairs to restore your water heater's function versus the cost of purchasing and installing a new system. Because the anode rod wears away over time, it's important to inspect and replace it as needed in order to maintain your water heater.</p>
<p>Outside of the GPM produced by most tankless heaters, there are a few heaters that go beyond the average, heating 7.5-11 GPM. Tankless water heaters feature an adjustable thermostat control. Don't pay to heat a tank full of water while away or worry about a tank water heater springing a leak. To install this, you will need some tape measure, a spirit level, a square edge, a pencil, an electric drill, a drill bit and a fixing kit suitable for the wall, a T&P valve and drain, a wrench, a hammer, oakum, jointing compound.</p>
<p>The water heater isn't producing hot water. However, as with a traditional tank-style water heater they will eventually wear out and need to be replaced. If you notice several of the above symptoms it's likely your hot water heater is failing and it needs to be repaired or replaced. Although they can be a bit more expensive than the traditional models, the benefits you have on the tankless is satisfactory compare to the traditional water heater.</p>

The good news is that electric water heaters don't need venting. While many water heaters have a long service life in your home, these important pieces of equipment do not last forever. This way you will cut the installation costs. When the hot water tap is turned off, the water heater turns off.</p>

If your current hot water heater cannot meet your needs, new water heater installation is likely the best choice.
