When we think of water heater temperature problems, our minds usually jump to the scenario of having no hot water.</p>
<p>The initial cost for an electric or gas-powered tankless water heater starts at about $1,000 and can go up to $5,000 with re-wiring service for the home. These systems can either reduce or eliminate your need for grid powered water heating. Tankless water heaters are more efficient and sturdier than traditional tank style units.
