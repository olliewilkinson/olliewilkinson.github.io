<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Replacement Batavia</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters are still unusual in the U.S., where tank-type water heaters have been used for many years. Although a second unit might seem like a large investment, it can actually save you money in the long run since you'll use less water while waiting for hot water to arrive and less gas to heat the water. A tankless gas water heater needs a gas line to the water heater, and the unit must be vented to the outside.</p>
<p>If you have ever done those things you might have found out that the T&P Valve wouldn't close properly after checking it and the water heater drain valve now leaks. We also install tankless systems. We will come in and replace any old piping, fix you up with corrosion-free drain plugs, and install the most energy-efficient models built today. Install the various fittings that come with the water heater. Estimate how much hot water your household uses during peak hours and look for a heater with a first hour rating (FHR) that meets your demand.</p>

KEEP YOUR INDOOR PLUMBING WARM - Open your kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors to allow heat to get to pipes under sinks and vanities near exterior walls, and keep a small trickle of water running at vulnerable cold and hot faucets.</p>
<p>Most tankless water heaters can be repaired and have parts exchanged as well, so replacing the entire water heater every 6-8 years is a thing of the past. In the case of the gas tankless water heater installation you are required to have a PVC vent installed that penetrates the roof of your home or that you mount it on the outside of the home and purchase a special outdoor tankless water heater which may also require an enclosure and re-working your water supply lines.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Batavia Illinois 60510</h3>
<p>Typically, water heaters that are over 10 years old need replacement, but with annual maintenance you may be able to prolong the water heater's life to 15 or 20 years. They cost more up front than standard electric models, but use about 60% less energy, meaning homeowners tend to see a return on their investment in the form of lower energy bills. If it's time to replace your conventional water heater with something better, a tankless unit might be the perfect choice.</p>
<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
<p>In part that's because removing a large tank takes more time and effort than removing the much smaller tankless units. You'll also notice it's no longer necessary to run the water until it heats up. Although it costs more upfront, in the long run a tankless water heater is a money-saver. You should contact Premier Plumbing as soon as you notice you have no hot water, warm water, or less hot water than normal. When you need water heater repairs, you can rely on Horizon Services to get the job done right the first time.</p>

Speaking of, you should absolutely have your new tankless water heater installed by a professional. Low water pressure is a typical problem with tankless water heaters and is usually caused by running too many hot water appliances at one time.</p>
<p>Tankless Water Heater Installations also typically require a flush kit to be installed for maintenance purposes. Replacing the anode rod regularly will significantly increase the life span of the water heater. Popular water heater brands are popular because of their reputation, and brands vary in price. Consequently, a tankless water heater is able to deliver as much instant hot water as you need and not a drop more.</p>
