<h2>Water Heater Services Monson Massachusetts</h2>
<p>All households require hot water, so your water heater is one of your most essential home appliances. As the name suggests, this type of water heater does not have a storage tank. Regularly scheduled maintenance can help extend the life of the water heater and it includes performing a water heater flush, checking the valves and connections for leaks and more. If you are not looking to apply more then one outlet then you would be well served by the standard and far less expensive model of the tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Propane is available as both traditional tank water heaters starting at $560, and tankless products beginning around $600, other options include a single, wall-mounted, tankless, 1.5 GPM shower unit with a battery powered igniter and a showerhead for approximately $110. A tankless water heater may be the right option for you. Currently, there is too little data to accurately estimate life expectancy for tankless water heaters, but preliminary data shows that tankless water heaters could last up to 20 years.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the type of traditional hot water tank you had, you may be able to install it in the same area. In addition to high upfront costs, smaller tankless units don't always deliver enough hot water to appliances and showers simultaneously. Our 24-hour emergency plumbers offer a complete range of solutions that can get a faulty system back up and running in no time. Many homeowners are interested in how tankless water heaters can save them money, since these units are more energy efficient than their tank counterparts.</p>
<h3>Affordable Hot Water Heater Repair Monson</h3>
<p>Also consider the hot water heater installation cost or water heater replacement cost. Additionally, if you have a gas system, you will need to modify the gas lines feeding the heater and this can be very costly. All this makes choosing a gas or electric tankless hot water heater a local matter. A tank-less water heater has lower operating costs, uses less space and can reduce energy consumption by as much as 30%.</p>
<p>Water underneath the water heater is almost always a sure sign that your water heater needs replacing. Raise the gas burner or the lower heating element on an electric water heater at least eighteen inches above the floor if the equipment is in the garage. In large homes however, you might need more than one for a proper supply of hot water. Generally residential water heaters have a life expectancy of 8-12 years.</p>
<p>Instead, they have a heating system that allows for on-demand hot water. The biggest trend currently is tankless water heaters. If you choose to proceed with a new water heater installation, we offer financing options to ease the upfront cost burden. A tankless hot water heater is a heating element installed near the point of use. Some may include a specific exclusion to water damage from water heaters or burst pipes — so it's useful to learn when your policy is applicable.</p>

Our comfort advisors would be happy to discuss your new-build plans, assess your family's water heating needs, and help you make an informed decision about whether or not a tankless water heater installation would be right for your home. When an electric water heater doesn't heat water, either the power to the water heater has been interrupted or the controls or heating elements are not working.</p>

Disconnect the water lines from the old water heater. Tank or tankless water heaters cost between $216 to $903 to repair, with an average cost of $552.</p>
<p>Compare this to a traditional water heater tank, which usually only gets 7-10 years of life before it needs to be replaced. Many utility companies offer rebates on certain models of water heaters, generally those certified as low energy utilizing models. Tankless water heaters that use natural gas are about 23 percent more efficient than a traditional storage version, which is about 60 percent efficient, according to the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>Sometimes, your water heater will give you signs that it's struggling before it dies. Installing the temperature controls can be tricky if you aren't familiar with them, so make sure you read the instructions regarding this part of installation as well. An average household of 3 - 5 spends approximately $40 to as much as $100 per month in electricity for hot water heating purposes.

One of the most important ways to maintain the functionality of a tank-type water heater is to flush the tank.
