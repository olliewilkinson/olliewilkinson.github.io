<h2>Water Heater Services Lebanon New Jersey</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank.

You usually notice a leak when there is a puddle around the bottom of the water heater or they may be a trail leading back to the tank.
