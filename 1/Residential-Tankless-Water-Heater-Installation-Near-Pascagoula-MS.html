<p>The most obvious drawback to a tankless water heater is the higher cost for both the unit and the installation. When sediment has built up inside your tank or the heating element stops working, we might be able to repair it. Elements can corrode due to a higher mineral content in the water such as you typically find with well water. Tankless water heating technology checks all the boxes to a more comfortable home.</p>
<p>The water heater is a fairly simple appliance. When the distance between heater and fixture exceeds 50 feet, look for units with a built-in recirculation pump, which saves water and reduces waiting time. If your water heater is leaking contact us and we can assist you in shutting off the leaking water heater to help minimize any possible water damage. Tankless water heaters, on the other hand, do not store water.</p>

They take up less space, there's a lower chance of them running out of hot water, they have a longer lifespan, and they have a lower chance of sediment gathering in them because there's no large tank that is storing water.</p>

If you need your water heater replaced, we're up for the task.</p>
<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there. If there is adequate electrical service and room in the breaker panel, electric tankless is a great option. The heating element in the unit heats it up to the temperature that is desired. Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>
<p>If the tank is cold or very hot, it may be difficult to get the expected changes when dialing in different temperatures on the thermostat. Next, the water heater must be connected to a fuel source. Before removing your old water heater, we'll assess your property's specific needs and recommend the most cost-effective option.
