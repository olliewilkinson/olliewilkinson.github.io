<p>Initial Cost - Tank heaters are cheaper to purchase and typically less expensive to install. However, f you use more hot water daily (around 86 gallons or more), then you may only get to enjoy an additional 8-10% energy efficiency. With sediment piling up on the bottom of your tank, your water heater is trying to heat water through the mound of dirt, leading to a longer wait time for your water to heat.
