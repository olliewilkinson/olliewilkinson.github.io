<h2>Water Heater Services Fort Gratiot Michigan</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Keep a reservoir of hot water available at all times so that when you turn on the tap, it's ready to use. The water passes through a heat exchanger, where heat from either natural gas or electrical heating elements is applied to it. The heat exchanger is activated by the movement of water, so the water is only heated when a tap turns on demanding hot water somewhere in the house. Leak repair: If you notice water anywhere near the unit, call a plumber right away.</p>
<p>Solar water heaters use a storage tank that keeps water heated by the sun. For thread-in-type elements like we show here, you'll need a water heater element wrench ($5 at home centers and hardware stores). Tankless water heaters are different in their rating system—they are sold according to the demand they can meet, the flow rate, and are measured in gallons per minute (GPM). If you're running out of hot water too quickly, there are a couple things to check.</p>

In fact, your home's gas piping, gas meter and gas line to the meter may not be sized appropriately to handle the high gas load that will be replacing the conventional storage gas water heater. The next indication that you can use to determine you need a new water heater is that there is an actual leak on the tank itself.</p>
