<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
<p>A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state: In those colder states with a more drastic rise from the temperature of the incoming water to the desired temperature, the tankless water heater is not able to produce as many GPM. So, when it comes to the selection and installation of your new water heater, you should rely on the experts America trusts for water heater services.</p>

<p>Gas units are available in a large variety of models and sizes for both home and commercial use and range in output from 130,000 to 380,000 BTUs. Another very common water heater repair issue is no hot water. First, check the water heater's circuit breaker in the service panel to make sure it hasn't tripped.
