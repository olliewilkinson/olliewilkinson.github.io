<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Slatington PA</h3>
<p>Petersen Plumbing does not recommend tankless water heaters in locations with hard well water, or where galvanized steel pipe is present either in the building, or in the water service to the building. Capacity: The size of on-demand water heaters should be based on the number of occupants in the home and their peak hour water demand, rather than the size of the house. Units that undergo routine checks and upgrades last longer and undergo less frequent and costly repairs.</p>
<p>Determining whether you should repair your water heater or purchase a new one depends solely on what is wrong with it in the first place. They know from experience which models of heaters tend to hold up the best to the hard water. Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity. Tankless systems heat water by activating a set of coils that become hot when the unit is turned on. As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>
<p>Turn OFF the electricity to your water heater at the circuit breaker panel. Replacing your tankless water heating unit should not have to happen often since these models typically last 20 years. Properly operating water heaters are relatively quiet. Tankless water heaters continue to increase in popularity as people learn more about their energy-saving and hot water-providing benefits. Since there's no need to keep the water hot in case it's needed, tankless models consume less energy.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Slatington Pennsylvania 18080</h3>
<p>Typically, water heaters that are over 10 years old need replacement, but with annual maintenance you may be able to prolong the water heater's life to 15 or 20 years. They cost more up front than standard electric models, but use about 60% less energy, meaning homeowners tend to see a return on their investment in the form of lower energy bills. If it's time to replace your conventional water heater with something better, a tankless unit might be the perfect choice.</p>
<p>John Wood : These are Canadian-made, high-efficiency hot water tanks. Our team of well-respected technicians and installers are unsurpassed in their training and their craftsmanship when it comes to installation and tankless repair.

<p>With a conventional tank heater , households with moderate to high rates of consumption will find that they can run out of hot water if they need to use a lot of hot water quickly. The gas hot water replacement cost would be between $1000 and $2500, in a different location. The smaller unit reduces your risk of getting scalded, since huge amounts of hot water aren't stored in a tank, but rather are processed as needed.</p>
<p>You'll also need assistance because water heaters are heavy and bulky, making them difficult to handle. With a tankless unit in place, you can rest assured knowing the system will provide clean and fresh water to your faucets.
