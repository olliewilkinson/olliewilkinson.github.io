<h3>Water Tank Repair Fort Smith Arkansas 72903</h3>
<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, on the other hand, need to heat water as it passes through. There are numerous people that would agree that the storage type of tank hot water heater that is powered by gas is the most efficient machine. A tankless water heater provides hot water only when you need it, which ensures it doesn't produce standby energy losses like a storage water heater.

It's estimated that gas water heaters last for up to 10 years and electric ones up to 15 ‚ but don't think you don't have to maintain and troubleshoot certain things about your hot water heater to meet, or even exceed, these projected lifetimes. The installation process is more time-consuming, and fewer plumbers know how to install them correctly.</p>
<p>If you do opt for a whole house tankless heater then get yourself a hot water demand system. If your water heater has an EF of at least 0.82, you can qualify for federal tax credit. Incorrect installations can shave years off your water heater, can significantly reduce its performance, and can expose you to unsafe conditions.
