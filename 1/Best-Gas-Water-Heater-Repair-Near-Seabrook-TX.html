You'll need to have the water heater cleaned out, but we also strongly recommend installing a water softener to eliminate the problem at the source. With tankless electric water heaters, there is a direct relationship between the flow rate of a fixture (demand), the power supplied to the tankless electric water heater, and the output temperature of the hot water.</p>

If the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a new one, getting a new one is more economical.</p>
