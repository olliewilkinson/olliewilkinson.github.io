For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time can stretch a tankless water heater to its limit. Energy savings, endless supply of hot water, low operating cost, reduced risk of power problems, space savings and durability, and safety and assurance are the other advantages.</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing.
