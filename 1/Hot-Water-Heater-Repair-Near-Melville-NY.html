With fewer components and no bulky water tank, you will require fewer repairs and your unit will last about 5-10 years longer than a traditional unit. Storage tank water heaters store 40 to 120 gallons of water at a time and constantly reheat that water regardless of how much is actually demanded.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters never run out of hot water, putting an end to organizing cooking, laundry, and showering around how much hot water is in the tank. Installing a tankless water heater is NOT a DIY job. It is not necessary to wrap Teflon tape or to apply pipe dope on threads of the new element(s) unless the new element specifies the use of it (especially if the replacement element has a gasket).
