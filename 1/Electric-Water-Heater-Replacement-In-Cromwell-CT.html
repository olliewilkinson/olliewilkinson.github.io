<h2>Water Heater Services Cromwell Connecticut</h2>
<p>There are several reasons for and against installing an electric tankless water heater. No two brands of tankless heaters are exactly alike, and an improperly installed unit will more than likely underperform. Call (855) 982-2028 to schedule your water heater repair service. Having an incorrect setting can cause your water to be too cold, too hot, or cause your heating elements to work constantly. If your tank is gas powered, you'll find gas connections below the tank at the pilot light. The idea behind this type of water heater is to reduce wasted energy by heating the water as it runs through the pipe instead of keeping it in a tank and spending energy to keep it at one temperature twenty four hours a day.</p>
<p>Keep a reservoir of hot water available at all times so that when you turn on the tap, it's ready to use. The water passes through a heat exchanger, where heat from either natural gas or electrical heating elements is applied to it. The heat exchanger is activated by the movement of water, so the water is only heated when a tap turns on demanding hot water somewhere in the house. Leak repair: If you notice water anywhere near the unit, call a plumber right away.</p>
<p>A local plumbing company such as Atlas Home Services eliminates the guesswork—and the hassle—around replacing your old water heater. By some estimates, a tankless hot water heater uses 22% less energy than its traditional counterpart. Whether you are in of water heater repairs or you're interested in upgrading to a newer, more efficient tankless model, our expert plumbing technicians can help.
