With a tank heater, the element is usually the first thing that goes out, usually well before the tank itself does. This reduces damage to the tank caused by overheating.</p>

To prevent this pressure from building up, every water heater uses a relief valve in its construction. Homeowners often ask if a gas water heater or an electric unit is more cost-efficient.
