<h2>Water Heater Services Fairfax Station Virginia</h2>
<p>Thermal couple repair is probably the most common repair on a gas fired water heater. Most, if not all codes require that gas burning equipment be installed where they have enough air to "breathe". The type of fuel required will affect not only the operating costs but also the purchase price of your tankless water heater. If you currently have a water heater that's in fine condition but you are looking to upgrade to a new one, the plumbers at All About Plumbing & Septic are able to help you.</p>
<p>In third place is the gas-powered tankless water heater. Water, not warming enough is one of the most straightforward sign you will receive from your instant water heater if something is wrong. And electric tankless models draw so much power—120 to 160 amps—that you may have to upgrade the electrical service to your house to 200 amps or more. In most cases, a person is going to notice that there are small signs that the water heater is getting ready to fail before it completely quits.</p>
<p>An especially significant motivation is the 50% reduced heating costs over using a hot water tank. If you got a water heater that only worked for two people, it's not going to work as well when there are four to 10 people working or living in space. If you already have a booster installed in your home, we are also a water heater booster repair company and we service boosters as well. Whining noises indicate sediment has built up on the heating element and will cause lower water temperatures.</p>

In most cases, people who get combination space and water heating systems are doing new construction, but you can also retrofit these units with existing sources for heating water.</p>
<p>Electric tank-type heaters utilize electrical-resistance heating elements located within the hot water storage tank to heat up the water within the tank. There is no need for a storage tank nor is there any energy wasted on heat loss with the tankless heating systems. Hot water heaters heat up the water supplied by your friendly utilities company, allowing you to do things like luxuriate in hot, candle-lit bathtubs, wash beautiful bone china, and keep yourself in a steady supply of clean underwear.</p>
<p>An electric water heater will occasionally pose the same problems as a conventional water heater, such as leaks and mineral buildup, but with the addition of an electrical system. Rumbling, popping or banging noise from inside the water heater. Codes require a subpanel (which may be supplied along with the unit) to be installed next to the unit. The electric heaters on the other hand can last from ten to fifteen years.</p>
<p>Most of the time, if you are not getting hot water, it is because the pilot light on your water heater is out. It is recommended that you hire a licensed, professional to install your water heater. We are the leading water heaters company in the region and are known for providing prompt and high quality gas & electric water heater repair services. Hot water heater replacement shouldn't be a gamble for your family.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Fairfax Station Virginia 22039</h3>
<p>Water heater usage costs $150 to $700 per year. WATER HARDNESS: Scale deposits that form in a heat exchanger (or on electric heating elements) slow down heat transfer and constrict water flow. The plumbing runs from the heat exchanger in the hot water tank, to the expansion tank, up through the solar collectors above, down through the pressure relief system, and then finally back to the heat exchanger in the tank.</p>
<p>The further your water has to travel from the water heater to its destination, the more noticeable the gap. He will also show you the easy way to carry a water heater out of your home, even if you are working alone. Tankless water heaters can be installed on walls, in garages, or outdoors using an anti-freeze kit. Also, as I mentioned earlier, tank-style heaters break down over time due to hard water causing the inner lining of the tank to rust and corrode.</p>
<p>A tankless water heater will cost $1,950 installed. If you are experiencing issues with your water heater before the ten year mark you may be able to get away with a repair instead of a replacement service, depending on the issue at hand. Without a working water heater, you'll be stuck with cold showers, dishes you can't properly sanitize, and a washing machine that won't clean your clothes. Descale the heater and flush it according to the maintenance steps.</p>
<p>See what others have to say about them before calling them to handle your emergency tankless water heater repair. Solar water heaters utilize a storage tank that stores water heated by the sun. Recovery speed is the amount of time it takes to heat a full tank of water. Here at Ben Franklin, we offer conventional tank water heaters, electric water heaters, gas-fired water heaters, tankless water heaters and even solar water heaters.</p>
<p>On the other hand, gas tankless water heaters need you to have the right kind of gas - which could either be propane or natural gas - before you install any unit. Plus, with technology that operates only when hot water is needed, ultra-efficient heating coils, no pilot light and no storage tank, you save on energy and utility costs. Energy Efficiency: As water heaters age, they become less energy efficient, using more gas or electricity to generate less hot water.</p>
