With all this in mind, it's generally better to let an expert install your tankless water heater. If you start to hear rumbling from your water heater, keep an eye out for any small leaks.

You are not afraid of running out of hot water again since they instantly heat water instead of warming a large bath tub or pool perhaps. One solution to the long wait is to install a small tank water heater after the tankless water heater to act as a tempering tank, but once you do that, it's no longer a truly tankless system.</p>

<p>We've got over 30 years of experience with tankless water heater installation, tankless water heater replacement and tankless water heater repairs. Many homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters in order to save on water, energy, money and space. 1)When a hot water faucet is opened this causes water to flow through the tankless unit.

Water travels in pipes through solar collectors (typically installed on your roof), where it is heated by the sun. Turn on the cold water supply valve to the water heater and turn on the water supply valve (or the house water supply, as applicable). Traditional storage water tank heaters, also known as "boilers" are the most common water heaters installed for the last 120 years or so and are used for central heating and can also heat the water for your home using steam.</p>
