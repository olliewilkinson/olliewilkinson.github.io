Call Lee's Plumbing: Once the plumbing experts arrive, they will assess the situation and walk you through the necessary repairs. These systems heat the water as it is requested, which is why they are also known as on demand” water heaters. Tankless models only require enough power to heat the amount of water needed at any given moment, meaning they use less energy, which translates to utility savings. It's important for homeowners in Bucks and Montgomery County to also consider the efficiency, cost, and size of their new water heater.</p>
<p>If the water heater is located in an attic, water damage can result in every ceiling and floor beneath the water heater. Your water requirements will also have to be considered when choosing a tankless water heater. Our GoHot tankless heater is only the size of a briefcase. Since we are talking about electric tankless, the only thing I will say about gas models is that they almost always have better performance than electric models.</p>

<p>You should flush your water heater once per year to help remove sediment or rust that may be building up. This will greatly increase the life of your water heater and can even extend it beyond the manufacturer's warranty timeframe. Many of our customers see the benefit of installing tankless water heaters because they're compact, efficient and reported to save nearly 40% on energy costs ( DOE ). And the harder your heater has to work, the more it will be exposed to high temperatures and make the tank brittle.</p>
<p>Not all water heaters can be repaired. The great news is that there are only a few things that can go wrong with water heaters because they have only a few parts. So that increases the installation cost even further. If you flush your tank heater annually and call for professional service when you experience any operational issues, you will ensure your heater the maximum lifespan. High Energy Bills: Your water heater, particularly if you have a traditional tanked unit, is one of the highest consumers of electricity.</p>
