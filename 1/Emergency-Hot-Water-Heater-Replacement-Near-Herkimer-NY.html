If your demand is higher, then a whole house” tankless water heater or two or more tankless systems will be able to keep up with the demand of your household.

The cold water is then heated rises up and becomes evenly dispersed throughout the tank.</p>

The actual zone in which the water heater is installed doesn't matter. Tankless water heaters are also supposed to be drained and the filters cleaned every month.</p>
<p>Tankless hot water heaters are also a good choice for most retro projects, and should be considered a good choice for second homes and weekend retreats where the percentage of standing hot water is wasted. Flexible copper connectors are easier to install than solid copper, especially when the existing pipes and the tank inlets don't line up. But not all local codes allow them. Age of the Heating Unit: The average life of a water heater is about 8 to 12 years.</p>
<p>The drain valve is located at the bottom of the water heater. And there are no large electrical power demands needed as with the electric heater. Not enough hot water may also mean that your water heater is on its last leg and needs to be replaced.

Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
<p>8. A good indicator for both electric and gas heaters is the sacrificial anode rod. Your water heater is under constant stress to deliver enough hot water for your family. There are some less common causes that can make your electric water heater not as effective or efficient as it used to be.

New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company. Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
