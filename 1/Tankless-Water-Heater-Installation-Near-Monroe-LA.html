<h2>Water Heater Services Monroe Louisiana</h2>
<p>Although water heaters typically last for a number of years, they do need to be replaced from time to time. A tankless water heater is an excellent option for modern homes: they can keep up with the demand of the majority of households (provided they're sized correctly), cut down on energy bills, and won't run out of hot water the way standard storage tank water heaters do. We are proud to offer top quality installations of tankless water heaters in Bethesda, MD and throughout our wide service area. I don't think there's a best” time to buy a new water heater, but as with any appliance, around major holidays (Labor Day, Memorial Day, etc.) are usually good times.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>
<p>This problem is only compounded as sediment build up in the tank over time and reduces the amount of hot water the tank can store. In the case of installing electric tankless water heaters you may be required to have an electrician upgrade the electrical service to your home or plug, depending on its age and set up. We have a wide variety of gas and electric tank water heaters available in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>
