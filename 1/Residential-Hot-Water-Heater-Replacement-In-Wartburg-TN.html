<h2>Water Heater Services Wartburg Tennessee</h2>
<p>Thermal couple repair is probably the most common repair on a gas fired water heater. Most, if not all codes require that gas burning equipment be installed where they have enough air to "breathe". The type of fuel required will affect not only the operating costs but also the purchase price of your tankless water heater. If you currently have a water heater that's in fine condition but you are looking to upgrade to a new one, the plumbers at All About Plumbing & Septic are able to help you.</p>

Water heaters are a necessity today and need to be well maintained to ensure a hassle-free lifestyle.

<p>Energy Savings: Because these units only heat water when it's needed, you can save big on energy costs. Water heaters are essentially steel tanks with vitreous glass bonded to the inside to protect the steel from rust. Retrofitting a home with a tankless unit can be a complicated process as compared to traditional storage tank and may cost as high as $3,000. Gas water heater: Turn off the gas supply at the shutoff valve on the gas pipe nearest the water heater.</p>
<p>Because hot water is essential to our everyday lives, it is important to manage and maintain your hot water heater. Tankless heaters do not have a large standing water supply, instead they instantly heat the water to the necessary temperature as it is required.

A tankless water heater system allows you to have the hot water you want on demand without any hassles.</p>
<p>If your heater is approaching old age, replacement may be smarter than repair. They can supply endless hot water because they begin heating water as soon as a faucet is turned on.

<p>Turn off the water and gas or electric before you begin, and take particular care to vent gas models properly. Use 2 T joints to divide the hot and cold water inlets, so as to fit the water heater onto one side and the shower, sink, bath or washbasin on the other side. With an electric hot water heater, several other components could be causing you to lose hot water. Solar water heaters work using roof-mounted solar panels that absorb the sun's heat and transfer it to an antifreeze-like fluid in a closed-loop system that runs to the water tank and heats the water.</p>
<p>To keep your hot water tank in tip top shape and ensure it lasts as long as possible, call us for annual water heater maintenance. So now if your ready to buy a new tankless water heater, the only thing left you require is help with the installation. Instead they heat water as it passes through the unit, using a heat exchanger to rapidly bring it up to temperature. One of these factors is the power source of the water heater.</p>
<p>Tankless heaters take up less space compared to the space of a 20 or 80-gallon tank. Single point tankless units can be installed on the interior or exterior of the building near the water use point and no more than 50 ft. from an adjacent power source (typically requiring 220 volts) if using an electric heater. Typically, tankless water heaters, which heat water only when you need it, cost more but can save about 25 percent of annual water heating costs, on average.</p>

<p>To give you an idea of how tankless and tank-style water heaters compare in terms of size, the average 40 to 50-gallon tank-style heater is 54 to 60 inches tall with a 20-inch diameter and is shaped like a cylinder. No matter what types of repairs, maintenance, or installation services you need, let our Atlanta water heater experts handle the details so that you can get back to normal life with hot water.</p>
<p>A lot goes into installation, including safety, plumbing permits from the county, and gas, electrical, or other connections. For starters, with an electric hot water heater you you can kill the gas line coming into the house, if you already have one or completely eliminate the need to put one in, if you do. This will leave you with one less bill to worry about. As these heating systems are tankless, your risk of flooding is diminished.</p>
<p>If water is pooling around the base of your heater, it means it's probably leaking.
