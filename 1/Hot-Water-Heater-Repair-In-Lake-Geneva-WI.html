<p>A tankless water heater on the other hand is small, handy, and takes up less space in your home. Electric varieties are also easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less likely to lose heat. Your hot water heater should work now. Now you need to fit the water inlet to the water heater. For nearly 30 years, we've been the trusted name in heating services offering an unmatched level of service. This can mean that the time range for installation can be from 2 hours for an electric unit to up to 7 or 8 hours for a gas unit that requires a new line and updated plumbing.</p>
<p>Please contact a professional to fix and maintain your hot water heater. Turn off the water inlet and outlet valves on the water heater. When it comes down to powering the heating process, tankless water heaters use 30-50% less electricity than water storage tank models. When you need hot water, the tankless water heater draws cold water into the heater, circulates it around a heat exchanger, and sends it back out into your home's piping.</p>
<p>As the water flows over the coils it is properly heated so you never have to wait for it to get to the right temperature when it reaches the outlet. If using a single point unit, you want the unit fairly close to where the hot water will be used in order to deliver the water in a timely way. Storage tank water heaters are commonly found in most homes. Connect the shutoff valve and the sediment trap to the water heater following the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
<p>Our dedicated, expert technicians have extensive training and years of experience in the installation of new, high performing and energy-saving water heaters. Installing heating systems in your home can help you maintain a constant temperature. A tankless water heater only heats water when it's needed, which means lower water heating costs and no more having to worry about running out of hot water. Once the project is complete, your Installation Services Professional will familiarize you with the proper use of your new water heater and perform a final inspection of the project with you to confirm your satisfaction.</p>
<p>Although it's a relatively simple process, it takes a professional plumber to install a tankless water heater. Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
