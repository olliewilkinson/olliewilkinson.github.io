<p>For homes that use 41 gallons of water or less, tankless water heaters can be 24% to 34% more energy efficient. The tankless water heater usually heats water directly without requiring the use of a storage tank. These types of heaters have a lot of mechanical parts and need a professional to troubleshoot. Most property owners don't think about replacing water heaters until it's a need. For example, many homes, regardless of the type of fuel source used to heat hot water tanks now require a 4” exhaust pipe.</p>
<p>Age: If your unit is older, and especially if it requires repairs or replacement parts to keep it functioning, it can be more cost-effective to install a new unit. Frequent breakdowns are a good indicator that it may be time for a full water heater replacement. Tank-style heaters don't produce hot water instantly either but since they have a supply ready to go and don't need to kick on, it reaches the outlet more quickly.</p>
<p>Make sure you understand the types of water heaters available before you make a decision. You can also save money on the purchase price of a new hot water system replacement, as the WELS water saving shower head help reduce the hot water installation size and cost of the hot water system required.
