<h2>Water Heater Services Stevenson Ranch California</h2>
<p>A gas hot water heater is the most common type you will find in most households. The best way to prevent emergency water heater repairs is to schedule regular maintenance for your system. Long lasting - Traditional tank water heating systems generally come with a warranty of up to 6 years. Here, the water is heated using either a gas burner or electric element as it passes through. If you've had enough of waiting for your water tank to heat the water, there is the option of a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>1. Tankless water heaters require regular ongoing maintenance in order to run at their best efficiency. This requires a great deal of energy and puts incredible strain on the unit, which is why storage water heaters wear out after only eight to 12 years. In addition, SETS tankless water heaters are the only systems that offer a 100% lifetime parts replacement warranty. The downside is that, if you have multiple showers running at the same time, tankless water heaters are not able to keep up. This isn't just a problem with showers, depending on the size of your water heater, you can run into issues by having a shower and the dishwasher running at the same time.</p>
<p>Get estimates for how much it will cost to update your home's current venting as well as its current electrical system or gas fittings. Today's plumbing code requires all tank-style water heaters to have a temperature and pressure relief valve that opens to release pressure and eliminate the possibility of the tank exploding. Traditional water heaters are easier and less costly to install, but they do cost more to run.</p>
