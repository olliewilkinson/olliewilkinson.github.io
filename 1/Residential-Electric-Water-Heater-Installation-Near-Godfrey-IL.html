<h2>Water Heater Services Godfrey Illinois</h2>
<p>The plumbing system is a vital part of the home which requires care to keep it functioning properly. Getting an oversized heater is a waste of money; while heaters with too low capacity will not supply sufficient hot water. The plumbers at Ben Franklin Levittown can also recommend the precise replacement heater needed for your water heater based on how many people live in your home within the budget you set. Our specialists can install, repair, tune-up, or replace any hot water heater. This saves energy, but could also waste water.</p>
<p>Fortunately, since tankless heaters do not have a tank, there is absolutely zero risk of an explosion ever occurring. Sometimes the hot water tank in the system is the only one used to provide the home with hot water—and many modern solar water tanks come with a built-in electric element for auxiliary heating when the sun isn't shining enough. In commercial settings, manifold systems link multiple tankless units together to dramatically increase their heating capacity while decreasing the individual load.</p>
<p>Solar water heaters use a storage tank that keeps water heated by the sun. For thread-in-type elements like we show here, you'll need a water heater element wrench ($5 at home centers and hardware stores).

However, tankless water heaters are more energy efficient because you're only heating water as you need it. A water heater with a tank needs energy to heat up to 100 gallons, for example, and then needs energy to keep it hot all day long or until it's used.</p>
<p>Thanks to the coated heat exchangers, your tankless water heater will last longer and be less subject to corrosion. 7.

Also, you will save money because the tankless water heater doesn't have a tank. However, the type of water heater you need for your home will greatly depend on what fuel type you already have.</p>
<p>On more recent water heaters, the combustion chamber may be sealed. This matters since it would require more power to heat colder water.

If this happens, you should reduce the demand for hot water by limiting simultaneous applications, and you may want to consider resetting your unit. Traditional tank water heaters take up valuable space in a basement, attic or closet—space you could use.</p>
