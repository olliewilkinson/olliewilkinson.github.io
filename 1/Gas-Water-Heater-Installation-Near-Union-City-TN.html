<p>If you have a warranty of 12 to 15 years, which is typical, it doesn't make financial sense to replace a tank water heater with a tankless,” says Banta. Often an emergency, like a leaking water tank, is the reason a water heater is replaced. The Service Company Plumbing & Drains team is experienced in handling all types of water heater repair or replacement issues and can often have your hot water heater repaired or a new water heater installation completed same day in most cases.</p>

The fuel used by a water heating system will not only affect annual operation costs but also the water heater's size and energy efficiency.</p>

If your repairs are more frequent, it's better to put that money toward a new heater.</p>

On the other hand, tankless heater works in better efficient as water is heated on demand. If a heater isn't equipped with a built-in neutralizing cartridge, the installer has to add one. However, you should consider your usage preferences, energy supply, and space considerations when talking with your local water heater service provider.</p>
<p>January and November also seem to be good months to buy a water heater. Attach a new temperature and pressure relief valve to the heater. The electric tankless unit will only heat the water that you use and does not have the standby heat loss that typically comes with traditional tank-type products.

A unit that requires cleaning, maintenance, or repair will struggle to meet your hot water demands.</p>
