<h2>Water Heater Services Naugatuck Connecticut</h2>
<p>Although water heaters typically last for a number of years, they do need to be replaced from time to time. A tankless water heater is an excellent option for modern homes: they can keep up with the demand of the majority of households (provided they're sized correctly), cut down on energy bills, and won't run out of hot water the way standard storage tank water heaters do. We are proud to offer top quality installations of tankless water heaters in Bethesda, MD and throughout our wide service area. I don't think there's a best” time to buy a new water heater, but as with any appliance, around major holidays (Labor Day, Memorial Day, etc.) are usually good times.</p>
<p>Usually, these tanks hold enough hot water to meet the needs of the entire house. When we install a new water heater, our water heater experts will ensure that any gas and electrical connections are handled safely, and the water heater is installed properly. Endless hot water and lower energy bills are two reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters. You can enjoy consistent hot water by scheduling professional service when it's needed.</p>
<p>Your water heater doesn't start up: A failure to ignite or to turn at all can indicate a number of problems with your water heater, from the thermostat to the electric ignition. Our Austin plumbers constantly receive calls from individuals who notice that their water heater might have a problem. If your electric water heater isn't working the first thing to do is check your breaker or fuse box. Furthermore, tankless systems last nearly twice as long as traditional water heaters - up to 20 years or more.</p>

As always with plumbing equipment, check around for signs of leaks, but keep in mind that not all water around the heater indicates a leak. Alternatively you can combine an indirect water heater to a higher efficiency boiler. Tankless water heater repair insures your tankless water heater operates properly. Your tankless water heater only runs when you need hot water, so it is subjected to less wear and tear than a normal water tank.</p>
<p>With a tankless water heater, you can free up a considerable amount of space in your home for other purposes. If line voltage not found at the element and the top tank is cool, replace top controls. Our service techs specialize in water heater repairs and replacements, too. Not many buildings are the same; meaning each house works better with different water heaters. When you replace your hot water heater, you have two options.</p>
<p>Gallons Per Minute (GPM) represents the amount of hot water a tankless water heater provides per minute. If the extra costs of installing a tankless system are going to outweigh your potential savings, you may want to consider a tank system or a high-efficiency tank system.

<p>This figure is more important than the tank capacity for determining whether a particular hot water heater will meet your needs. We carry a variety of the conventional water heaters to meet every need. This model is also referred to as a demand-type” or instant” water heater, and provides hot water by heating up cold water as it passes through the unit, as opposed to storing it in a tank like a traditional unit would.</p>
<p>With a tank-style hot water heater, water is heated in a tank and stored until it is needed. Electric water heaters are powered by standard electricity to heat and cool the water that flows to your tubs, showers, sinks, dishwasher, and washing machine. Because tankless heaters do not store water, they are less subject to corrosion than tank-type heaters. All Pro Plumbing, Heating, Air & Electrical has all your water heater services covered.</p>
<p>These systems are also sometimes called on-demand water heaters because they only heat water when there is an immediate need for it. So there is no energy being wasted to maintain a tank of hot water that might not be used for hours, days, or even weeks if you are not at home. On the positive side, and despite the sticker-shock price tag, a tankless heater may be the best solution in a remote or infrequently used location.</p>

<p>8. Water coming out from the heater is not clean. In order to avoid having an emergency situation with your water heater, knowing when water heater repair is needed is about to help you prevent costly water heater replacements. Carbon monoxide and exhaust emissions produced by each type of water heater are completely different, as are their venting requirements. Tankless hot water heaters are usually situated fairly close to the point of use, which is generally the bathroom or kitchen and only give localized space heating and instant heated water in one outlet.</p>
<p>Place the water heater in a drip pan made for this purpose if the equipment is located inside the home, and especially if it is in the attic. Increasingly, consumers are turning to tankless water heaters for their many benefits. Tankless units are susceptible to failure due to hard water. Just keep in mind that water heaters have a typical life span of 10 to 15 years. The tankless water heater only makes hot water when a faucet is opened and stops when the faucet is closed, which adds to your home's efficiency and overall operating costs.</p>
<p>Before purchasing a tankless water heater, you will need to determine your hot water usage, which is measured in gallons per minute (GPM), and figure out your maximum hot water demand. Whether you go with an electric tankless unit or a gas one, you will save money on your utility bills. In some cases, a tankless water heater is located in a completely different location than the old water heater. If you have a tankless coil water heater, and you heat with oil, follow steps for "no heat." If you have a gas hot water tank, do not reset breaker or re-light pilot.</p>
