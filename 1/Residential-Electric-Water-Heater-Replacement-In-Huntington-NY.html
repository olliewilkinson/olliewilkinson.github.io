<p>Improve your home's water and energy consumption with a tankless water heater. Endless hot water: Because tankless water heaters produce hot water on demand, your supply never runs out. Gas hot water heaters have changed over the years as now most of them have a igniter for lighting the pilot and a gas valve with built in diagnostics.
