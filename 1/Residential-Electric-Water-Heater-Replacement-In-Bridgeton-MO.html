<h2>Water Heater Services Bridgeton Missouri</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>To expose the elements for testing, remove the two metal covers, the insulation and the plastic covers on the side of the water heater. Your water heater will be installed the right way the first time. This maintains a positive pressure within your home and lowers your energy bills of other heating products since it does not use precious heated air while also ensuring that your water heater receives an unlimited supply of quality oxygen-rich air at all times.</p>
<p>The voltage of most heaters range between 110V to 277V. This could happen at the top or bottom of the water heater, where the pipes come out. However, if your water looks rusty, has a funky smell, or produces a strange noise, it's time to call a professional for a hot water heater repair. The mobile home water heater never gets looked at till it breaks down, but just like your central heating boiler ay home, it should be serviced annually.</p>

To make sure your water heater is restored properly, schedule an appointment with our plumbing experts. In some cases, however, the water heater may need to be replaced. A high-temperature limit switch down by the viewing door at the bottom of the tank should protect the water heater from overheating.</p>
<p>Use channel-type pliers or a pipe wrench to loosen and disconnect the lines from the water heater. Over time, water heaters often suffer from sediment build-up that can damage the tank. For example, a sudden loss of hot water may mean that the pilot has gone out. Be sure to connect the cold water pipe to the cold water inlet on the water heater. Cold water enters the tank and is heated by an electric element or gas burner.</p>
