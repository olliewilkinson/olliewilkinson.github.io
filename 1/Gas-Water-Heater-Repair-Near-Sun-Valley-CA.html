<h2>Water Heater Services Sun Valley California</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most common and easiest way to heat water is by the use of a gas hot water heater, and this might be due to the fact that gas is capable of getting the tank up to operating temperature roughly twice as quickly as its electric counterpart, and the cost is also approximately half as much as electricity would cost. Tank water heaters are great and very reliable, but if you are looking for a more energy-efficient that can save you a lot of money, tankless water heaters are the way to go. At All About Plumbing & Septic, we are able to repair and replace tankless water heaters, as well as provide quality water heater installation service More and more people are investing in tankless water heaters because when it's not in use, it doesn't consume energy; with traditional tank water heaters, they are constantly heating water within in a tank.</p>
<p>Keep a reservoir of hot water available at all times so that when you turn on the tap, it's ready to use. The water passes through a heat exchanger, where heat from either natural gas or electrical heating elements is applied to it. The heat exchanger is activated by the movement of water, so the water is only heated when a tap turns on demanding hot water somewhere in the house. Leak repair: If you notice water anywhere near the unit, call a plumber right away.</p>
<p>Attach the vent pipe to the draft hood on the water heater (for gas water heaters only). A properly sized unit with sufficient air and gas inputs will provide efficient, on-demand hot water for your customers, leading to increased comfort and long-term savings. Now it's time to establish the cold (usually right side) and hot (usually left side) water connections. On a chilly day, it can take several minutes for hot water to travel from the hot water heater tank to your shower.</p>

In the case of the gas tankless water heater installation you are required to have a PVC vent installed that penetrates the roof of your home or that you mount it on the outside of the home and purchase a special outdoor tankless water heater which may also require an enclosure and re-working your water supply lines.</p>

<p>An expansion tank is a safety system for water that expands when it heats up. Most have a little room inside for expansion. A conventional water heater is a large, cylindrical tank with a heat exchanger inside. You will definitely want to have an expert take care of the installation if this is the first time a natural gas water heater is going to be installed in your house, as this will ensure that there is a large enough gap between the interior walls and the tank to prevent any possibility of fire.</p>

<p>By the third bucket, if the water from your heater is still coming out rusty, then most likely the water heater (not the piping) is at fault. We needed a new water heater, installed the end of May. Likewise, if the existing wiring in your home cannot adequately supply electricity to your tankless water heater, there is a small chance that the wiring could short, which could potentially start an electric fire.</p>
<p>From time to time, repairs are required to meet some common problems like lukewarm water, a small flow, or a leak. With tankless water heaters, there's no storage hot water tank to leak or break, thus reducing the risk of flooding. Before making repairs or purchasing a new water heater, check the nameplate on the side of your current unit. Heating your water can use a lot of energy. If steam or excessively hot water shoots out of faucets, or you hear boiling sounds inside the water heater, the appliance may not be shutting off at its set temperature.</p>
