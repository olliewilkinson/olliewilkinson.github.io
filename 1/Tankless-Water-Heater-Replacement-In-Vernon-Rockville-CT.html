<p>Tankless electric units emit zero greenhouse gasses and are 20%-30% more efficient than ones with a tank. Homeowners who are asking themselves are tankless water heaters worth it will find that the answer depends on where they live, the prices for installation in their area, and the way in which their household uses hot water. When we think of water heater temperature problems, our minds usually jump to the scenario of having no hot water.</p>
<p>Water heaters that are not installed correctly can leak, causing water and mold damage. If water does take a long time to get to a faucet, the real solution is to add a circulation system to your water's heat source.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Vernon Rockville Connecticut 06066</h3>
<p>Typically, water heaters that are over 10 years old need replacement, but with annual maintenance you may be able to prolong the water heater's life to 15 or 20 years. They cost more up front than standard electric models, but use about 60% less energy, meaning homeowners tend to see a return on their investment in the form of lower energy bills. If it's time to replace your conventional water heater with something better, a tankless unit might be the perfect choice.</p>
<p>In addition to the upfront cost, which carries significant weight in the decision for many, other factors also include the number of people in the house, any remodeling in the home, as well as the expense to operate the heater. If you see a dip in water pressure whenever you turn on your hot water, there may be some damage to the plumbing lines.

Without a working water heater, you'll be stuck with cold showers, dishes you can't properly sanitize, and a washing machine that won't clean your clothes. Descale the heater and flush it according to the maintenance steps.</p>
<p>More expensive low-density elements are usually folded back like the one shown in Photo 5. These provide the same amount of heat but spread out over a larger surface area, which lowers the surface temperature, making them less prone to mineral buildup. Keep a distance of 24″ between the combustibles, the water heater, and the output hot water pipe. Colder climates mean colder incoming groundwater temperature, resulting in a need for more energy to heat the water to your desired temperature.</p>
<p>We'll update you about your water heater repair appointment via text, email or phone-whichever you prefer.
