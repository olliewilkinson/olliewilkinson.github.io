<p>Because water heaters are so important to your home's comfort, making sure your system performs at peak levels with as much efficiency as possible is of utmost importance. On top of that, electrical tankless water heaters cost less than most tankless gas units. So if your property does not already have a gas connection, the cost of making this connection will negate any cost savings of a tankless system. For this reason, installation costs will vary based on a home's floor plan and how far the piping needs to be directed through the house.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters have been growing in popularity lately, especially with the new water heater energy efficiency regulations. A gas water heater typically will have an EF between 0.50 and 0.80, with electric heaters around 0.90. A higher EF means more energy-efficiency and likely lower operating costs.
