<p>It's hard to believe it, but over 19,000 water heaters are replaced every day. Most conventional natural-draft water heaters vent exhaust completely different than any tankless water heater, and though they are a fuel burning appliance, they do need power to operate. Many thermostats have a reset button which can sometimes be pushed to reset the circuit and get the water heater working again. Once we've discussed your viable options and you've made a selection, our technicians can carefully remove your old water heater and safely install your new one.</p>

<p>Tankless water heaters are more energy and space efficient, have a longer lifespan and perform better than conventional water heaters, but most homes are still equipped with conventional heaters, whose average life span is ten to fifteen years. Tankless water heaters offer a proven alternative to the storage tank water heaters most commonly found in US homes. The job of the temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve is to release excessive pressure from steam buildup, but the TP valve may have been improperly installed, or it may be faulty.</p>
<p>The water is heated by a couple of electric resistance elements that extend from the side of the tank into the middle of the water. There are times that the pipes cause the issue and not the water heater. Many storage tank water heaters take longer to heat water, because of the larger volume of water they must heat, than most tankless types. For example, if a gas powered tankless water heater is not properly connected to its gas supply line, a gas leak could develop.</p>
<p>Check the surrounding pipes for leaks that could damage the water heater. After the hot water tank in the system is an expansion tank installed to help keep pressure levels in the system at safe levels. Even when well-maintained, a tank-style heater will only last up to about 15 years, which means you'll have to spend even more replacing it.
