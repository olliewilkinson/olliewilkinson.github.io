<h2>Water Heater Services Shelbyville Kentucky</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>Not enough hot water - If you have limited hot water before it runs out, your heating elements are not properly doing their job. Most water heaters in New Mexico use natural gas and this means you have to burn combustible fuel to heat your water. You can achieve even greater energy savings of 27%-50% if you install a demand water heater at each hot water outlet. A conventional water heater burns money, as it is constantly heating water you don't use.</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing. If the water is still as hot as it was before you turned the temperature down, it's because the thermostat isn't working. That's why it's important to regularly maintain and, if necessary, repair your hot water tank — and that's a task that AirPlus Heating & Cooling can assist you with.
