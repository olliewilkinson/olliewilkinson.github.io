<h2>Water Heater Services Nekoosa Wisconsin</h2>
<p>Tankless water heaters, both gas and electric, are pretty much in demand these days, as they are considered to be one of the most energy efficient appliances available today. Gas-fired tankless water heaters produce higher flow rates than electric ones. Some popular models include Bosch Aquastar 2400ES Gas Tankless Water Heater, GE Indoor Tankless Gas Water Heater Model GN94DNSRSA and Rheem Tankless Water Heater RTG-74PVN-1, Indoor Use. Water Heater- Install what you are taking out if you have a 40 gallon and want to upgrade to a 50 gallon now is the time to do it. If you do have a 50 gallon I DO NOT recommend switching to anything lower than what you have.</p>
<p>Although it rarely happens, explosions are a serious risk with tank-style water heaters. A gas-powered tankless system has to use burners just like a tank system. However, they're also more costly to install and may struggle to provide hot water to multiple fixtures or appliances simultaneously. Tank water heaters are a common type of water heater. While they can be much more expensive than traditional units, tankless water heaters do deliver big long-term savings.</p>
