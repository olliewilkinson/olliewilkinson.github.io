<h2>Water Heater Services Watertown Connecticut</h2>
<p>One modern day luxury that we often take for granted is the ability to have a hot bath or shower at the flick of a water faucet. But if you use hot water only in the morning and in the evening, like most full time working people do, your energy bill will go down substantially. It is very common for water heaters to have sediment buildups, either if the water has a high amount of minerals or the heater get older. It allows for significant energy savings and an endless supply of hot water. With a tankless hot water heater installation, you will no longer have to heat water all day and night.</p>
<p>Whenever you are ready to move forward with your tankless water heater project, your plumber or licensed installation professional should be well versed in the current status of rebates available and add that information to his recommendations. We carry out full-service water heater solutions, including repair, installation, and replacement. It may take a few hours before your water heater if fully heated. This typically requires a larger diameter gas line for gas units or a higher voltage power supply for electric ones.</p>
<p>A local plumbing company such as Atlas Home Services eliminates the guesswork—and the hassle—around replacing your old water heater. By some estimates, a tankless hot water heater uses 22% less energy than its traditional counterpart.

Check the Energy Factor (EF) to see how efficient the unit is. A higher EF rating indicates better efficiency.</p>

Our water heater team offers all water heater services, including 24-hour emergency repairs and replacements. Defective water can heaters consume a lot of gas and electricity, so you'll save quite a bit of cash by upgrading to an Energy Star-qualified model.</p>

If your water heater is more than ten years old, often it's more cost-efficient to opt for replacement rather than repair when things go wrong. Electric water heaters look similar to their gas-fueled cousins.</p>
<p>An expansion tank is a safety system for water that expands when it heats up. Most have a little room inside for expansion. A conventional water heater is a large, cylindrical tank with a heat exchanger inside. You will definitely want to have an expert take care of the installation if this is the first time a natural gas water heater is going to be installed in your house, as this will ensure that there is a large enough gap between the interior walls and the tank to prevent any possibility of fire.</p>

Hot water system installation cost depends on the distance from the existing hot water system installation and the electrical work required. Alternatively, odd noises coming from the water heater itself could point to sediment being burned by the heating element in the tank, or the heating element itself.</p>
<p>The further your water has to travel from the water heater to its destination, the more noticeable the gap. He will also show you the easy way to carry a water heater out of your home, even if you are working alone. Tankless water heaters can be installed on walls, in garages, or outdoors using an anti-freeze kit. Also, as I mentioned earlier, tank-style heaters break down over time due to hard water causing the inner lining of the tank to rust and corrode.</p>
<p>As such, this is the main reason you should focus on upgrading your water heater, as the old one is woefully out of date. Rheem Tankless  Water Heaters offer the savings, comfort and protection  you need. Most tankless water heaters can supply sufficient warm water to your entire household, but if your family uses a considerable volume on a daily basis, you'll want to make sure the unit you select is sized to meet your needs.</p>
<p>The Temperature and Pressure Relief Valve (TPR) is an essential water heater safety feature. Replacing your water heater with a new, more efficient one, could lower your high energy bills. Turn on a faucet, and there it is. When it runs out, it has to consume energy to bring new water up to temperature. While they're picking up the new one, tell them to slap some flexible pipe connections on your credit card, too, in case your new water heater's dimensions aren't the same as the old one's.</p>
<p>Other times, a replacement may be necessary. If so, call the Indianapolis, IN water heater replacement company that you can trust. The larger the tank the more a unit will cost. A new water heater is a major investment of your resources and it needs to be carried out meticulously and with care. Some store heated water for use at a later time, whilst others heat water on demand. The alternative is a technology that's been around for more years than you might think - tankless water heaters.</p>
