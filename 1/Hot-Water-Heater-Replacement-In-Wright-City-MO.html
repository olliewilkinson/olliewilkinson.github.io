<p>The size of the openings for combustion air — from indoors or outdoors — is based upon the tankless unit's Btu input. Tankless water heaters for RVs are becoming increasingly popular specifically for this. I was impressed the first time that I saw a tankless water heater. Even if you have an existing gas line, it may need to be upgraded to a bigger pipe in order to accommodate the power needed to fuel the tankless unit.</p>
<p>Additional materials: some of the tankless systems will also be incompatible with the location and setup of older storage tank models. Many, like Navien tankless water heaters, qualify for energy efficiency rebates and credits from local utility companies because they are certified Energy Star products. Further, some gas condensate tanks cost almost three times as much as a traditional gas storage tank. We provide both residential and commercial HVAC and plumbing services in Natchitoches, LA and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters function differently from standard water heaters - a water flow sensor controls the water flow into the heater.

With over 70 years of experience, we have what it takes to replace your failing system with the high quality water heater needed to get your hot water running again.

<p>Small tankless water heaters only heat water when you demand it. This model of heater uses gas burners or electric coils to heat water as it's needed. If the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your water heater. May reduce water heating bills by as much as 30 percent. The additional insulation to improve energy efficiency makes these water heaters wider.</p>
<p>This means hooking up water lines and, for gas units, tying in the gas line and a ventilation system to remove exhaust fumes produced by burning gas for heating. Depending on the number of people in your home and your daily hot water needs, a water heater that once provided sufficient hot water may have trouble keeping up with your current demands, especially if they have changed. Enjoy your new water heater and the satisfaction you have in doing it yourself.</p>
