As many homeowners look for ways to lower their energy costs, one area of improvement is water heating.</p>

<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Saint Marys GA</h3>
<p>Most DIYers try to make their own water heater repairs in an effort to save money. A tankless water heater installation really isn't all that complicated and there aren't too many parts that have to be purchased. Gas is more energy efficient and cheaper to run, but electric will not make a drastic difference. Tankless Water Heaters have become a really hot commodity in the last couple of years (I know, that was a really bad pun).</p>
<p>Tankless can also be a good choice for large families because you have more people consistently using more hot water. There are many reasons why these are much better than the tank heaters, but let's consider the most important reasons to switch over, money. If your water heater has rust-colored water or if your water heater leaks , let us know. The initial cost of a combination or integrated water and space heating system is going to cost you more than if you install a separate heater and furnace or boiler, but both installation and maintenance costs are probably going to be less.</p>
<p>Continuous Hot Water: Because a tankless water heater heats the water as it's used and doesn't rely on a full tank of hot water, you're not limited by your tank's size. If you have a gas water heater, we verify that the flue is clear prior to making the final connections. We can help you maintain your new water heater, too, so you can be sure it will last for quite some time. The only way to know if your current hot w. heater is collecting minerals and deposits is to call a qualified plumber and have them come out and inspect your w. heater.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
<p>If you would like to make your water heating even more energy efficient, then you can consider one of the tankless models that are available. You're Never out of Hot Water: With a tankless water heater installation, cold showers will be nothing but a memory because they supply hot water on demand. Also, taking into account some of the feedback received from the cost guide, we added two paragraphs, one to the Types” section, and another one in the Labor” section, giving advice on which water heater to buy when living in a cold climate, as well as information about labor prices for installing it.</p>

There are ways to prevent sediment buildup, including regular maintenance, using a water softener to reduce the number of contaminants in your water, and keeping your overall water heater temperature at or below 130 degrees.</p>
