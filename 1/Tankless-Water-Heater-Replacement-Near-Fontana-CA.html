<h2>Water Heater Services Fontana California</h2>
<p>Installing a tankless gas water heater is a very worthwhile investment and one that will pay for itself in a very short period of time. Without a warranty, you could end up spending a lot more on repairs of an old water heater than you would if you upgraded to a new model. Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed. However, you also have to decide between these three tankless water venting systems: a direct vent system, a non-direct vent system, or an outdoor tankless system.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters eliminate the long wait for heat of the traditional hot water tank. 3)The amount of water that the heater allows to flow through is regulated by the desired outlet temperature. Condensing water heaters are an option if you heat with gas and need a unit with a capacity of more than 55 gallons. Planet Plumbing & Drain offers hot water heater replacement services in Boulder, Longmont and Denver metro areas.</p>
<p>The water heater anode rod will become caked with contaminants over time, which will cause the rod to be eaten away and eventually need to be replaced, but this component is very inexpensive when compared to the cost of a new water heater. Our technicians can recommend the proper repairs or water heater replacement if necessary. Fast, efficient, and always with the highest quality service, depend on us to fix your geyser and heater any time of the day, any time of the year.</p>

<p>If you have a gas hot water heater, the pilot light might go out and leave you without hot water. Our Lombard water heater installers will assess the problem and present you with accurate solutions.

After completing all the connections, the final step is to connect the new water heater to the power supply. Our tankless Installation price includes the job from start to finish along with the removal of old equipment and materials.
