<p>Water heater usage costs $150 to $700 per year. WATER HARDNESS: Scale deposits that form in a heat exchanger (or on electric heating elements) slow down heat transfer and constrict water flow. The plumbing runs from the heat exchanger in the hot water tank, to the expansion tank, up through the solar collectors above, down through the pressure relief system, and then finally back to the heat exchanger in the tank.</p>
<p>T&P Valve usually comes with the new heaters. The tankless water heater is going to end up saving you money if you choose to have one in place in your home or business. However, if there is sufficient pressure and the run length is short enough, it is possible to use a ½-inch line, which is used by most existing storage tank-type water heaters.

Speaking of, you should absolutely have your new tankless water heater installed by a professional. Low water pressure is a typical problem with tankless water heaters and is usually caused by running too many hot water appliances at one time.</p>
<p>Because electric power is more expensive than gas, these units are better suited for smaller jobs. New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company. Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
