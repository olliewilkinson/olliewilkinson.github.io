<p>Overall, there are situations where a hot water tank is a better choice over a tankless water heater. Vents also need to be installed to ventilate the unit. Low maintenance: With no storage tank to drain, clean, and protect from corrosion, tankless water heaters require less maintenance, and may last longer than traditional storage-tank water heating equipment. Tankless water heater built with condensing technology has lower costs of installation.</p>
<p>The Temperature and Pressure Relief Valve (TPR) is an essential water heater safety feature. Replacing your water heater with a new, more efficient one, could lower your high energy bills. Turn on a faucet, and there it is. When it runs out, it has to consume energy to bring new water up to temperature. While they're picking up the new one, tell them to slap some flexible pipe connections on your credit card, too, in case your new water heater's dimensions aren't the same as the old one's.</p>
