<p>Whether you need a new water heater installation or some help with maintenance, you can trust our plumbing experts to help keep your home and family comfortable. Besides energy and cost savings, there are several other reasons to choose a tankless water heater over a traditional tank-style heater. Tankless units are complicated. Gas hot water not working is unusual, as gas hot water systems tend to be very reliable.</p>

Increasingly, consumers are turning to tankless water heaters for their many benefits. Tankless units are susceptible to failure due to hard water. Just keep in mind that water heaters have a typical life span of 10 to 15 years. The tankless water heater only makes hot water when a faucet is opened and stops when the faucet is closed, which adds to your home's efficiency and overall operating costs.</p>
<p>As such, this is the main reason you should focus on upgrading your water heater, as the old one is woefully out of date. Rheem Tankless  Water Heaters offer the savings, comfort and protection  you need. Most tankless water heaters can supply sufficient warm water to your entire household, but if your family uses a considerable volume on a daily basis, you'll want to make sure the unit you select is sized to meet your needs.</p>
<p>Gas water heaters will have a higher FHR compared to an electric heater with the same sized tank. It's estimated that gas water heaters last for up to 10 years and electric ones up to 15 ‚ but don't think you don't have to maintain and troubleshoot certain things about your hot water heater to meet, or even exceed, these projected lifetimes. The installation process is more time-consuming, and fewer plumbers know how to install them correctly.</p>
<p>The requirements are designed to increase the use of low emission water heaters. The easiest way to mod your RV with a tankless water heater and get that sensational endless shower is to use an inline device that replaces the shower head. For a place that uses a lot of hot water and more then one outlet at one time then you do not want to get the standard tankless water heater. You could have an undersized heating element(s), failed element, a 240V heater wired to 120V service, etc.</p>
