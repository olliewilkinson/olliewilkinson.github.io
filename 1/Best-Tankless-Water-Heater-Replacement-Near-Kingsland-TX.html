<h2>Water Heater Services Kingsland Texas</h2>
<p>When it comes to water heaters, there is strong disagreement as to which one type of electric hot water heater is better: whether gas hot water heater or the electric hot water heater. Furthermore, some types of water heater damage cannot be repaired and always require system replacement, regardless of the age of your water heater. Installation for these gas pipes require professionals who know the risks and safety measures needed to ensure that there are no leakages that can cause fires and accidents. This hybrid system makes use of your current plumbing and is a great choice for restaurants or other locations where there is a high demand for hot water.</p>
<p>This is because the flow of energy is easier to regulate with an electric connection, plus the pilot light has to be properly ignited with a gas connection. And no tanks means no hot water sitting unused, reducing your overall heating costs by hundreds of dollars. If it's too big, you may be spending more money than necessary to heat up the water within the tank. We keep water heaters stocked at TLC so we can replace your water heater day or night.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters usually need more gas than even the biggest home furnaces. We have been specializing in San Jose water heaters including installation, replacement & repair since 1968. Keep in mind, there is always a direct relationship between the amount of power in and the output temperature of your hot water. This could be because the heating element itself needs to be replaced or because the power supply isn't reaching the element.</p>

<p>Water underneath the water heater is almost always a sure sign that your water heater needs replacing. Raise the gas burner or the lower heating element on an electric water heater at least eighteen inches above the floor if the equipment is in the garage. In large homes however, you might need more than one for a proper supply of hot water. Generally residential water heaters have a life expectancy of 8-12 years.</p>

<p>Storage water heaters lose heat and can cost a lot of money in maintenance over time.

A main unit could be repositioned to shorten the run to some of the most used outlets while a smaller electric on-demand heater could be use to supplement in a bedroom or utility room. Plus, many tankless units, even those that run on gas, require an electrical connection to operate, which may require an additional supply line to be installed.</p>
