Multiple units can be plumbed in parallel to increase the volume output of hot water. 2. Tankless water heaters deliver hot water faster. Because tankless models can deliver better performance and energy efficiency - that's why. We are the most trusted HVAC contractor, providing professional water heater installation and repair services.</p>

<p>Water heater replacement: Your water heater works harder than any other plumbing fixture in your Chicago home. Make sure that the gas valve is turned on. If you have a gas tankless water heater, find the gas valve ( seen here as the gas supply” ). If it's in the OFF position, just rotate the handle counter-clockwise to the ON position. First you're going to want to turn off the gas, power, and water supply to the tank.</p>
<p>Pick the water heater that best fits your water usage, lifestyle situation, and budget. When you are not using hot water, the heater's internal sensor automatically switches off the heat exchanger. However, installation costs are lower owing the absence of a furnace. The gas hot water heater should utilize a removable anode which helps to prevent chemical reactions between the chemicals present in the tank which may cause erosion.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, produce hot water only when you want it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when added to homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water each day, according to They also last about two times as long as a tank water heater.

<p>To keep your hot water tank in tip top shape and ensure it lasts as long as possible, call us for annual water heater maintenance. So now if your ready to buy a new tankless water heater, the only thing left you require is help with the installation. Instead they heat water as it passes through the unit, using a heat exchanger to rapidly bring it up to temperature. One of these factors is the power source of the water heater.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble with your existing water heater, schedule an in-home consultation and let one of our professional, licensed technicians inspect your unit. Tankless water heaters are far more efficient because they do not waste energy keeping water hot when there is no demand for it. Maintaining the temperature of a 50-gallon tank of water takes a lot of gas or electricity that is not needed with the in-demand style of water heaters.</p>
