<p>Installing a tankless hot water heater can be pricy. Fortunately, it can be easily remedied with a simple call to the experts at Valley Air Heating, Cooling & Plumbing. Identical water heaters don't always perform as well. In colder climates like ours with colder groundwater, smaller tankless water heaters will only deliver enough hot water for one shower at a time. Moreover, much of the heat produced by the pilot light of a tank-type model heats the water in the tank, heat that is just lost with the instantaneous units.</p>
<p>Gas models can deliver up to 96% thermal efficiency and generate a constant flow of 4 gallons per minute, resulting in continuous hot water for your home. However, a broken thermostat can also tip the water temperature in the opposite direction and can mean that your hot water gets way too hot.
