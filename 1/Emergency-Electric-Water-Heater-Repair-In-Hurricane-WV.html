<h2>Water Heater Services Hurricane West Virginia</h2>
<p>The water heater is one of the most important pieces of equipment that anyone has at their home. Since almost all tankless heaters are designed to maintain a desired outlet temperature, they have to restrict the flow through the heat exchanger to do so. This means that there is a limit to how much hot water they can provide at a given temperature rise or "Delta T". Basically, if you try to use more hot water at one time than the heater can provide it will limit the output volume to maintain the desired temperature.</p>
<p>Your water heater is your last defense for dealing with freezing cold water, which is why you should always stay on top of regular maintenance and care. Whether it's powered by electricity or natural gas, your water heater isn't built to last forever. Once the system is all hooked up and properly tested, you're ready to start using your new water heating system. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that in homes using 41 gallons or less of hot water, on-demand tankless units can conserve between 24% to 34% more energy than tank water heaters.</p>
<p>With hot water pipes adequately insulated with materials like foam pipe insulation sleeves, your plumber can help your home become more energy efficient. Similar to gas-fired tank-type systems, gas-fired tankless systems include a vent that removes any by-products created during the combustion process. Typically, tankless water heaters provide hot water at a rate of 2-5 gallons (7.6-15.2 liters) per minute. If your electric hot water heater is slow to heat, runs out of hot water faster than it used to, or doesn't deliver any hot water at all, there's a 90 percent chance that simply replacing one or both of the heating elements will solve the problem.</p>

Along with our furnaces and boilers, our water heaters are also available in various styles, efficiency levels, and brands - one of which includes the Navien brand.</p>

<p>2. You can decide to replace it when you get discolored or tainted water when you turn on the hot tap. For homes with high daily water demands, multiple tankless heaters can be installed.

Without a working water heater, you'll be stuck with cold showers, dishes you can't properly sanitize, and a washing machine that won't clean your clothes. Descale the heater and flush it according to the maintenance steps.</p>
<p>While having options is great, as well as having unlimited hot water, there are other reasons that people are wild about tankless water heaters. Unless you are quite confident in your skills, it's best to let a professional handle water heater installation. In 2015 from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy published findings on the total cost over 13 years for many different water heaters. The required steps to set up your specific water heater may vary.</p>
