They constantly heat water so hot water is consistently ready. While traditional water heaters maintain a constant supply of hot water for your use, a tankless unit heats water quickly on demand.</p>
<p>We install tankless water heaters for commercial and residential customers in the South Bay & Los Angeles, including Torrance, Redondo Beach, Harbor City & surrounding areas.

The most important decision regarding water heaters will be choosing whether you want to install a unit with a conventional storage tank or a tankless model.</p>

If the pilot light is out, follow the instructions posted on the water heater or the details below here to relight the pilot light. Reconnect the wire that was removed from the heating element to perform the resistance check in the previous steps. Visit the pages on different types of water heaters (linked above) for more on estimating costs.</p>

Eventually, it can burn out the heating elements in your water heater, shortening its lifespan. Open several hot water outlets for a couple of minutes to purge any air from the pipes and water heater.</p>
