<h2>Water Heater Services Theodore Alabama</h2>
<p>Various devices at home allow us to live and move comfortably. It also means that you should never run out” of hot water, because it is continually heated for as long as you leave hot water running. Electric tankless water heaters are quickly growing in popularity given their potential energy savings and ability to deliver hot water on demand. Interior tankless heaters need to bring in air from the outside, and there are two different methods to accomplish this: power vent and direct vent.</p>
<p>Your water heater is your last defense for dealing with freezing cold water, which is why you should always stay on top of regular maintenance and care. Whether it's powered by electricity or natural gas, your water heater isn't built to last forever. Once the system is all hooked up and properly tested, you're ready to start using your new water heating system. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that in homes using 41 gallons or less of hot water, on-demand tankless units can conserve between 24% to 34% more energy than tank water heaters.</p>
<p>Direct vent heaters are slightly higher in efficiency over standard water heaters but are significantly less efficient than tankless water heaters. The statistical life expectancy of a storage tank water heater is 10-12 years, depending on care and maintenance. For those suffering from a leaky water heater, John Moore can even repair your water damaged walls and floors without the headache of dealing with multiple contractors.</p>

New equipment installations typically increase efficiency and help reduce the energy bills of our customers by only heating water when you call for it; unlike conventional water heaters that heat all the water in the tank at once. Too much hot water usage can deplete the tank's supply, meaning one unfortunate person gets left with a cold shower.</p>
<p>Solar water heaters are efficient but expensive. If you purchase a tankless heater by a good brand such as Bosch, Kenmore or American Water Heater, it can last as long as 20 years without being repaired or replaced.
