You can enjoy consistent hot water by scheduling professional service when it's needed.</p>
<p>An especially significant motivation is the 50% reduced heating costs over using a hot water tank. If you got a water heater that only worked for two people, it's not going to work as well when there are four to 10 people working or living in space.
