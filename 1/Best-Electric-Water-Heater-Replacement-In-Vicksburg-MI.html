One of the great features with on demand water heaters is that they use heating coils to heat the water as it passes through the pipes.

<p>If it doesn't ignite, leave the hot water running and try lowering and then raising the temperature setting on the dial until the burner ignites.

The latest technology can be found in the on demand water heaters. In addition, water damage due to poor maintenance of your home isn't covered.</p>

The biggest residential electric tankless can deliver less than 5 GPM at a realistic temperature rise.</p>

Electric water heaters typically last a year or two longer than gas models, but not always. They also tend to have many fewer problems with them than other types of water heating systems. If you need your water heater replaced, we're up for the task.</p>
<p>The most popular brands of water heaters are reliable, affordable, have good value and are always available. While tankless water heaters run more efficiently than storage tank water heaters, replacing a tank water heater with a tankless can be expensive, and the payback time can be longer than the warranty. An undersized water heater may also be the problem if too much water is being used to heat it adequately.</p>
<p>Not all water heaters can be repaired. The great news is that there are only a few things that can go wrong with water heaters because they have only a few parts. So that increases the installation cost even further. If you flush your tank heater annually and call for professional service when you experience any operational issues, you will ensure your heater the maximum lifespan. High Energy Bills: Your water heater, particularly if you have a traditional tanked unit, is one of the highest consumers of electricity.</p>
