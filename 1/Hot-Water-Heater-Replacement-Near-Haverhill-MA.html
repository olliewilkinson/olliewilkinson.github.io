If it's too big, you may be spending more money than necessary to heat up the water within the tank. We keep water heaters stocked at TLC so we can replace your water heater day or night.</p>

The next indication that you can use to determine you need a new water heater is that there is an actual leak on the tank itself.</p>
<p>The most popular type of tankless water heater is a natural gas-powered model.
