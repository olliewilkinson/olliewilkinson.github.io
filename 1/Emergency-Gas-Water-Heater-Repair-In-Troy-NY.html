A reduction in efficiency due to this build up is also a common gas water heater problem, but the big issue is that it blocks the anode protection. For electric ones, the heating element may need to be replaced if it is acting up. This is why it's crucial to act on any leaks you might notice with the water heater.</p>
<p>Check that your electrical supply will adequately reach the tank.

<p>It'll take about 20 to 30 minutes to completely drain a 40 gallon water heater.
