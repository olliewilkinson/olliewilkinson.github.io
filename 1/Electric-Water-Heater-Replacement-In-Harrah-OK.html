<h2>Water Heater Services Harrah Oklahoma</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, installing a tankless system will be a good step at reducing your energy consumption and by just installing one, it will knock money off the utility bill.

<p>On a gas unit, also shut off the gas and unplug the electrical supply or turn off the circuit breaker.

Flow rate: Flow rate refers to how many gallons of hot water the unit can provide in a minute.

<p>Tankless heaters take up less space compared to the space of a 20 or 80-gallon tank. Single point tankless units can be installed on the interior or exterior of the building near the water use point and no more than 50 ft. from an adjacent power source (typically requiring 220 volts) if using an electric heater. Typically, tankless water heaters, which heat water only when you need it, cost more but can save about 25 percent of annual water heating costs, on average.</p>

<p>Water consumption (amount of hot water to be used) is another important factor in determining which heating system to purchase. Denver water is quite cold, which creates condensation on the walls of hot water storage tanks. Electric water heaters use, you guessed it- electricity, to heat the water. In fact, according to the National Association of Realtors , energy efficient upgrades such as tankless water heaters are among the top things that buyers are looking for in a home today.</p>
<p>That's where tankless, often called on-demand,” water heaters come in. You can get a low-end 50-gallon tank water heater for around $500 but a top-of-the-line Rinnai or Navien may cost around $1,500. Your water heater does not supply hot water constantly. With fewer components and no bulky water tank, you will require fewer repairs and your unit will last about 5-10 years longer than a traditional unit. Storage tank water heaters store 40 to 120 gallons of water at a time and constantly reheat that water regardless of how much is actually demanded.</p>
<p>Our installation process is fast and we can be out the same day you call with a new hot water tank heater. Tankless water heaters have become more popular because of their benefits. These only allow you hot water from one outlet at a time. Tankless water heaters are manufactured with energy-efficiency feature as a priority. Since tankless water heaters work by heating water from the external source on-demand, you could take a shower for 10 hours (or longer), and the water would be as hot as it would be for a 10-minute shower.</p>
