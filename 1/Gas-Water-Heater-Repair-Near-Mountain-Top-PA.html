<p>Water is leaking from the hot water heater tank. However, as long as your water usage at any given time is below the maximum allowable flow rate, tankless water heaters provide an endless supply of hot water. This is often provided by either a flame, on a gas water heater, or a heating element, on an electric water heater. They may require a mechanical permit, gas piping permit and electrical permit depending on the local jurisdiction and what was required to install the new appliance.</p>
<p>Many people think that electric hot water heaters are very expensive, and there are commercials seen often that indicate that gas water heaters are a better choice because they cost less and they keep working when the power goes out.

It really depends on the brand you buy, and the cost of the model purchased, but a traditional water heater will last 10 to 13 years, and a tankless water heater will generally last up to 20 years. If the circuit breaker or fuse repeatedly blows out, call a qualified electrician to check and repair the circuit.</p>

As the water heats, pressure builds inside the tank. The first tankless water heaters were only about two feet by three feet and bumped out from the wall about 12 or more inches.

If it's a conventional storage-tank water heater nearing the end of its 10 to 13-year life, replacement is obvious: New models are up to 20% more efficient and can save up to $700 in energy costs over the life of the unit.
