<p>Water is leaking from the hot water heater tank. However, as long as your water usage at any given time is below the maximum allowable flow rate, tankless water heaters provide an endless supply of hot water. This is often provided by either a flame, on a gas water heater, or a heating element, on an electric water heater. They may require a mechanical permit, gas piping permit and electrical permit depending on the local jurisdiction and what was required to install the new appliance.</p>
