<p>Heaters with water tank normally consume lots of extra energy to keep the stored water warm, which in turn, cost higher for the operation. Your old water heater was probably D rated, whereas these new units are A rated and better for the environment. This is the kind of energy-saving customization that is impossible with tank-style water heaters. That may be enough to supply a whole house in areas with warm groundwater, but in colder climes they're better suited to point-of-use service, where the demand for hot water doesn't get too high.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair East Elmhurst New York 11370</h3>
<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>

<p>Although it's a relatively simple process, it takes a professional plumber to install a tankless water heater. Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
