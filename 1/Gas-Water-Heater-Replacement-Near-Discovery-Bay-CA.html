With all this in mind, it's generally better to let an expert install your tankless water heater. If you start to hear rumbling from your water heater, keep an eye out for any small leaks.

Run clean water through the heater for a few minutes, using the same pump arrangement as before.</p>
<p>Indirect water heaters use heat from a boiler. Radiant heating is a type of heating setup where the heat is supplied by electric wiring or hot water tubes installed into or under the flooring, and sometimes walls and ceilings. The steps for replacing a propane water heater are exactly the same, and those for an electric water heater are similar. They use electricity to pump heat from the air or the ground to your water tank, using less energy than traditional water heaters.</p>
