<h2>Water Heater Services Hillsboro Illinois</h2>

Solar water heaters use a storage tank that stores water heated by the sun. Haven Heating and Air Conditioning is your local tankless water heater repair specialist, get in touch with us today. It's these two things: Flow Rate and Gallons Per Minute that determine what size heater you need and whether it should be gas or electric. There are several factors that can affect your water heater.

<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call. A tank-style water heater expends energy around the clock to maintain the temperature of a 40 to 50-gallon water supply so that hot water is ready when it's needed. Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>
<p>Tankless usually cost between three and five times as much as a normal water heater for the initial purchase. The problem may be caused by the water heater's main breaker.

<p>The difference between the two is how the water is heated - either through natural gas or electrical resistance coils. 1st Home & Commercial Services can upgrade your water system to the latest energy-efficient technology. Water heaters are one of the most important components of your plumbing system. No energy is wasted keeping water hot that may not be needed for several hours. In general, costs associated with heating water will be higher when using propane because the fuel is more expensive than natural gas.</p>
<p>The water is heated by a couple of electric resistance elements that extend from the side of the tank into the middle of the water. There are times that the pipes cause the issue and not the water heater. Many storage tank water heaters take longer to heat water, because of the larger volume of water they must heat, than most tankless types. For example, if a gas powered tankless water heater is not properly connected to its gas supply line, a gas leak could develop.</p>
<p>Tank-type water heaters store hot water so that it's available when needed. Whether you'd like an electric water heater, gas water heater, or an energy-efficient tankless water heater, our skilled plumbers can help with the selection and installation. Switch off the gas valve and turn off the electric supply to the heater at the circuit breaker — watch the pilot light go out to ensure no more gas remains.</p>
