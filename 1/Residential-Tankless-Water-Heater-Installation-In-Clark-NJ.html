<h2>Water Heater Services Clark New Jersey</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>
<p>This helps ensure that your new hot water heater is installed properly and will provide you and your residents and employees with years of hot water. Thermostatic control, which is the ability of the tankless water heater to modulate power output and give a consistent temperature, is also important, especially for those people on wells. We'll take care of any retrofitting that needs to be performed and get your new tankless water heater dialed in for maximum efficiency.</p>

This application requires a short water heater, a minimum of a 12” connector rise, 4” vent, and a new gas cock. Instead, why not turn to the new technology that has been around for 50 years - tankless water heaters. For larger households that use more than 86 gallons of hot water each day, tankless systems can be up to 14% more energy efficient than traditional water heaters.</p>
