<h2>Water Heater Services Ellijay Georgia</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>For a standard 40 gallon water heater you now only have about 34 gallons. The short delay between when the water starts to flow and when the heater kicks on causes a short burst of cold water before turning hot. Because methods for repairing the problem may depend on whether your water heater is gas or electric, these are discussed separately below. Electric Water Heater: For homes that are powered mainly by electricity, an electric water heater is likely the best option.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the type of traditional hot water tank you had, you may be able to install it in the same area. In addition to high upfront costs, smaller tankless units don't always deliver enough hot water to appliances and showers simultaneously. Our 24-hour emergency plumbers offer a complete range of solutions that can get a faulty system back up and running in no time. Many homeowners are interested in how tankless water heaters can save them money, since these units are more energy efficient than their tank counterparts.</p>

<p>It'll take about 20 to 30 minutes to completely drain a 40 gallon water heater. Keep in mind that the tank size you need should be based on the maximum amount of hot water you will need during busy times, not on the storage room available for it. In some cases, you may have to switch to an outdoor model is the size you need can't be accommodated in the space available inside your home. There are several different factors worth considering before purchasing a new water heater.</p>

<p>An expansion tank is a safety system for water that expands when it heats up. Most have a little room inside for expansion. A conventional water heater is a large, cylindrical tank with a heat exchanger inside.
