Residential water heater repair is our most common type of job, so you can rest assured that all our technicians are experts at such repairs.

<p>Homeowners looking to save on water heating expenses. Most gas tankless water heaters fall between 95,000-195,000 BTUs. Now though, if you need to repair or replace your heater, both Morco and Bosch have ceased production of these models. A standard water heater has to keep a constant supply of heat to the water inside the tank in order to have it at the right temperature when you need to take a hot shower or wash the dishes.</p>
<p>The most cost effective way to replace a water heater is to replace like for like. That's the equivalent of taking several showers, running the dishwasher, washing one load of laundry, and turning the faucet on and off multiple times,” says John Banta, an engineer who oversees our water heater tests.

<p>A tankless water heater warms up water as it passes through, eliminating the need for a bulky water storage container. Tank-type water heaters consume energy on an ongoing basis to keep water hot in a tank. Sizing a regular tank water heater can be quicker than a tankless water heater. Logic suggests that if you pay to heat water only at those peak times, it must cost less than heating water all the time. After you have had your unit looked at by the specialist, they will probably suggest that you either repair or replace your heater.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that Tankless water heaters require less energy, but they also are money to purchase and install. Clean where you're new tank will sit since you won't have access to this spot again for some time and once the new tank goes in, it could be hard to tell if you have new water messes or old water messes when you're testing the connections and such for your new tank. Contact a water damage company and your insurance agent to start the process right away because time is of the essence.</p>
