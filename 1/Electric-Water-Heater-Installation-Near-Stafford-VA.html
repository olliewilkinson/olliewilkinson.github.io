<h2>Water Heater Services Stafford Virginia</h2>
<p>A gas hot water heater is the most common type you will find in most households. The best way to prevent emergency water heater repairs is to schedule regular maintenance for your system. Long lasting - Traditional tank water heating systems generally come with a warranty of up to 6 years. Here, the water is heated using either a gas burner or electric element as it passes through. If you've had enough of waiting for your water tank to heat the water, there is the option of a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Water heaters need their own electrical circuits. If there is no hot water in the water heater, this may be because of a lack of power to heating the elements, such as tripped circuit breaker, a blown fuse handling water heater circuit, a faulty electric thermostat, or a faulty upper electric heating element. The good news is that newer hot water heaters aren't overly expensive and they will last for over a decade, making them a very good investment.</p>
<p>Your water heater doesn't start up: A failure to ignite or to turn at all can indicate a number of problems with your water heater, from the thermostat to the electric ignition. Our Austin plumbers constantly receive calls from individuals who notice that their water heater might have a problem. If your electric water heater isn't working the first thing to do is check your breaker or fuse box. Furthermore, tankless systems last nearly twice as long as traditional water heaters - up to 20 years or more.</p>

We have a variety of options for you including high-efficiency water heaters, electric water heaters, gas water heaters and tankless water heaters. Heaters produce heat, and that heat can cause a fire if not handled properly. Tankless water heaters provide hot water on demand, so regardless of household usage, you save money, energy and reduce waste by only heating water when you need it.</p>

As such, the most dangerous problem that could ever occur would be a serious leak with your water heater. If you closed the hot water faucet, you should open it again, as well as the T&P valve This will help the water drain faster by allowing air into the tank.</p>

Your old water heater was probably D rated, whereas these new units are A rated and better for the environment. This is the kind of energy-saving customization that is impossible with tank-style water heaters.
