<h2>Water Heater Services Littleton Massachusetts</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>Regardless of how well you maintain and care for your water heater, the average life span of most water heaters is from 8 to 12 years. If you live in the following neighborhoods of Agoura Hill, Downtown, Forest Cove, South end, Malibu Junction, East Agoura, and Old Agoura, then you need to find plumbing services to help you repair your heater. For nearly 30 years, we've been the trusted name in plumbing, heating, and air conditioning, offering an unmatched level of service at reasonable rates.</p>

<p>Gas-powered water heaters must vent out combustion fumes safely from the system. Unlike a storage tank water heater, which loses heat from the tank continually and must keep using energy to heat it up again, a tankless system only works when needed. After determining your fuel source, the next step is to decide if you are going to heat your water with electricity or natural gas. Your Assured Comfort plumbing experts will thoroughly examine your water heater, and explain the issue and your repair or replacement options.</p>
<p>Not every house or business is going to use the same energy source to run their appliances, which is why it's so great that tankless water heaters can either be electric or gas. However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>

<p>An expansion tank is a safety system for water that expands when it heats up. Most have a little room inside for expansion. A conventional water heater is a large, cylindrical tank with a heat exchanger inside. You will definitely want to have an expert take care of the installation if this is the first time a natural gas water heater is going to be installed in your house, as this will ensure that there is a large enough gap between the interior walls and the tank to prevent any possibility of fire.</p>

Storage water heaters are the large, familiar white tall, cylindrical tanks. After attempting reset, check the heating element for power again.

Another very common water heater repair issue is no hot water. First, check the water heater's circuit breaker in the service panel to make sure it hasn't tripped. The first question when shopping for a new water heater is whether you want to go with a tank or tankless model.</p>
