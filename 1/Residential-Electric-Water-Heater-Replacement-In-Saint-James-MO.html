<p>Probably the biggest disadvantage of traditional tank models is that you're limited by the amount of hot water the tank will hold. Here is where the tankless water heater comes in to play. The first thing homeowners want to check is whether there is water leaking from their hot water heater; and if it is a gas hot water heater, whether the pilot is lit. Tankless water heaters heat water on demand. Unheated water enters one side of the tank.</p>

The peak hour demand or first-hour rating (FHR) is the measure of how much hot water the heater will deliver in an hour, and the FHR is required by law to appear on the Energy Guide label.</p>
<p>This can happen if the gas supply is interrupted, the gas valve is turned off, or a gust of wind blows out the pilot light. Higher Installation Cost - Additional vents, additional tankless units, upgrading a portion of your electric line to 240 volts, or updating the plumbing might be necessary.
