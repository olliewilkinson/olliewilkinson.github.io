<h2>Water Heater Services Middleton Idaho</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>Call (855) 982-2028 to schedule service with our water heater experts. Additionally, the water cools and is re-heated in the tank several times each day while no one is home.

Direct vent heaters are the recommended types of heaters to install.</p>
<p>Strategically planning the location of your tankless water heater maximizes its flow and water temperatures. When you turn on the faucet, warm water is pumped from the top of the tank to where you need it and cold water is pumped into the bottom of the tank to be heated until its ready for use. Even though tankless water heaters can deliver an unlimited amount of hot water, there's a limit to how much water can be delivered at once.</p>
