The traditional storage tank hot water heaters are generally going to provide most people the gallons per minute of water they desire.</p>
<p>The maintenance necessary for your water heater depends on location, design of the unit, quality of installation, water quality, and manufacturer recommendations. You usually notice a leak when there is a puddle around the bottom of the water heater or they may be a trail leading back to the tank. Note: Unless the water heater stopped working more than a few hours ago, the water spilling out will be hot. Instead of storing heated water in tank, it supplies water only when needed.</p>
