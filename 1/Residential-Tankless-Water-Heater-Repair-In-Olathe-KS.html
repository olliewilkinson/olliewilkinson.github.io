<h2>Water Heater Services Olathe Kansas</h2>
<p>Tankless water heaters, both gas and electric, are pretty much in demand these days, as they are considered to be one of the most energy efficient appliances available today. Gas-fired tankless water heaters produce higher flow rates than electric ones. Some popular models include Bosch Aquastar 2400ES Gas Tankless Water Heater, GE Indoor Tankless Gas Water Heater Model GN94DNSRSA and Rheem Tankless Water Heater RTG-74PVN-1, Indoor Use.

<p>Once that hot water is gone, you will have to wait for a new 30 or 50 gallon tank to be heated again in order to have hot water. Tankless units supply a steady stream of hot water with no waiting and no running short. This cuts down on the wait time for hot water, provides you with a limitless supply, and allows for the whole family to gain access to hot water without waiting for your tank to refill. A typical tankless water heater installation can take a crew of 2 technicians an average of 6-10 hours, depending on installation requirements.</p>

The peak hour demand or first-hour rating (FHR) is the measure of how much hot water the heater will deliver in an hour, and the FHR is required by law to appear on the Energy Guide label.</p>
<p>Switching from electric to gas will add about $900 to the cost of hot water system installation. A heat pump water heater is more expensive than a standard tank-type water heater, but it's also about twice as energy-efficient. BTUs are the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. Please be aware that uninstalled units returned due to a home that has inadequate electrical service may subject to a re-stocking fee.</p>
<p>Instead of being limited by the capacity of a tank - like traditional units - a tankless unit heats water on demand, as needed. The number of model choices can be overwhelming, but Bill Smith Plumbing & Heating takes the time to understand your needs and ensures that the water heater you select meets current city, state and national rules. Loud pops or cracks indicate that the heating element is failing and needs to be replaced.</p>
<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
