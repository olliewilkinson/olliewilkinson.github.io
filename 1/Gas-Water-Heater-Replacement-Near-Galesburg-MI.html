Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box). Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>
<p>This is a type of heater that provides hot water only as it is needed. In order for the top element to have voltage and heat the water, the temperature of the water in the top of the tank must be lower than the temperature setting of the top thermostat.

In fact, your home's gas piping, gas meter and gas line to the meter may not be sized appropriately to handle the high gas load that will be replacing the conventional storage gas water heater.

If not, building-wide pipes and water heaters will need to be fixed.

Another advantage is that tankless heaters have a longer life span those ordinary heaters.</p>

A lot of times when this happens, its because the necessary repairs and maintenance were not scheduled for your water heater. Since the issue just started after you installed the tankless water heater, I would highly recommend calling the water heater company and asking them to come to take a look.</p>
