<h2>Water Heater Services Griffith Indiana</h2>
<p>When choosing a tankless water heater to go with, you have to first decide between tankless electric water heaters and tankless gas water heaters. Missing and improperly installed T&P discharge pipes are a common problem. Before you disconnect and remove your existing water heater, be sure to do all of the necessary preparation—you don't want to be stuck without hot water for a week or two while you're waiting for needed plumbing, electrical, or vent work. While the water is draining out of the old heater, Unbox the new water heater.

<p>Keep a reservoir of hot water available at all times so that when you turn on the tap, it's ready to use. The water passes through a heat exchanger, where heat from either natural gas or electrical heating elements is applied to it. The heat exchanger is activated by the movement of water, so the water is only heated when a tap turns on demanding hot water somewhere in the house. Leak repair: If you notice water anywhere near the unit, call a plumber right away.</p>

That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
