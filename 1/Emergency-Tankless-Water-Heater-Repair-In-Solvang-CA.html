<h2>Water Heater Services Solvang California</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>These are not required for gas instant hot water systems. Electric water heaters are high-voltage (240-volt) appliances that are dangerous to work with when the power is on. Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box). Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>
<p>In short, the answer depends on what brand and type of tankless water heater you buy. These are the arguments for investing in a tankless water heater. Instead of a storage tank, a tankless heater has a coiled chamber in it that works similar to the radiator in your car. For our California customers we will also properly earthquake strap and brace the water heater as required by the California state code for earthquake safety.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Replacement Solvang</h3>
<p>If your water comes out smelling like rotten eggs, there could be bacteria in the hot water heater tank. In our Chicago climate we experience extremely cold weather that can occasionally cause a main water line or incorrectly installed tankless water heater to freeze and prevent water from flowing. However, tankless water heaters are more energy efficient because you're only heating water as you need it. A water heater with a tank needs energy to heat up to 100 gallons, for example, and then needs energy to keep it hot all day long or until it's used.</p>
<p>Low or no hot water: Whether caused by sediment build-up, malfunctioning heating systems, or broken dip tubes, your water heater may fail to produce hot water or the temperature will be lower than normal. If your water heater is not getting power, be sure to turn off the circuit breaker BEFORE checking your electrical connections. A cross connection can occur in a failing shower valve (or any mixing valve) that allows cold water to pass to the hot side, letting cold water into the hot water pipe.</p>
<p>When it comes to installation, manufacturers recommend that you have a professional plumbing contractor help you with this process. And no one wants to pay for an exorbitant electric bill for hot water never used. Many jurisdictions consider new water heater installation and replacement water heater installation a different type of job (i.e., a permit may be required for one, but not the other). A tankless water heater in a bathroom is a popular option amongst today's homeowners.</p>

<p>Initial Cost - Tank heaters are cheaper to purchase and typically less expensive to install. However, f you use more hot water daily (around 86 gallons or more), then you may only get to enjoy an additional 8-10% energy efficiency. With sediment piling up on the bottom of your tank, your water heater is trying to heat water through the mound of dirt, leading to a longer wait time for your water to heat. If your water heater malfunctions, the first step is to turn off both the power and water supply to the water heater to prevent further damage.</p>
<p>Save money, improve efficiency of your heating system with our professional water heater and tankless water heater installation and repair services. They do require a storage tank, unlike conventional tankless water heaters, but because an indirect heater uses the boiler or main furnace to heat the fluid circulated through a heat exchanger in the storage tank, the energy that's actually "stored" by the tank lets the furnace turn off and on less frequently.</p>
<p>The good news is that by deciding to do it yourself, you will be saving anywhere from $1,000 to $2,500 in installation costs. Depending on the weather and other components, you have several selections for powering your new water heater.
