<p>A high-quality water heater installation can take a middle-of-the-road water heater and allow it to perform at its peak efficiency and longevity, while a poor quality water heater installation can cause even the best water heater to operate inefficiently and have a shorter-than-expected lifespan.

<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>The most popular brands of water heaters are reliable, affordable, have good value and are always available. While tankless water heaters run more efficiently than storage tank water heaters, replacing a tank water heater with a tankless can be expensive, and the payback time can be longer than the warranty. An undersized water heater may also be the problem if too much water is being used to heat it adequately.</p>
<p>A gas water heater can be used even during power outages, and are usually more ideal for a large family, as they have a fast recovery time. While these are cost-efficient at first buy, they are not the most efficient or reliable way for you to receive hot water, especially if your unit is outdated.
