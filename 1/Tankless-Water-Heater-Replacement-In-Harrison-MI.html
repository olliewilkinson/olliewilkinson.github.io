<p>When the water temperature falls below a preset level, the unit engages, and the water is reheated. This covers fuel type, tank size, energy efficiency and which models are within your budget. DIY water heater installations can be costly and ineffective. Sometimes however you may not have to replace the entire unit, but call a plumbing contractor for your water heater repair if the leak originates from the top.
