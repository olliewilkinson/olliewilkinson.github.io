<h2>Water Heater Services Woodland California</h2>
<p>Homeowners love to save time and hassle and may be able to when it comes to working on a water heater.

From inadequate water temperature to a complete lack of hot water, our technicians are trained to handle the problem.</p>
<p>These are not required for gas instant hot water systems. Electric water heaters are high-voltage (240-volt) appliances that are dangerous to work with when the power is on. Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box). Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>
<p>Check that your electrical supply will adequately reach the tank. Black Pipe Fittings - You may need a few ½ black pipe couplings and elbows to extend or shorten the gas line connecting to the heater. Tankless water heaters are becoming increasingly popular due to the energy savings and consistent flow of hot water. Tankless models cost up to three times as much as a tank water heater, but they more than compensate for it with their unique benefits.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair Woodland</h3>
<p>If the water coming out of your faucets is way too hot or it steams, it's possible that the water heater isn't shutting off at the temperature it's supposed to. This is probably because the temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve is malfunctioning. The most common complaint regarding a water heater is that it doesn't produce enough hot water. Our factory trained technicians provide 24 hour emergency service on all makes and models, and same day replacement with no charge for removal and disposal of your old water heater.</p>
<p>Scalding water is usually the result of a damaged pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. What it means for you is that using a tankless electric heater you will never run out of hot water while in the shower. Sometimes individual units are used in a number of locations throughout a house, but most newer homes have one high-output tankless heater to supply hot water throughout the home. Fits your budget: There's a great water heater for every budget.</p>
<p>Tank-type water heaters store hot water so that it's available when needed. Whether you'd like an electric water heater, gas water heater, or an energy-efficient tankless water heater, our skilled plumbers can help with the selection and installation. Switch off the gas valve and turn off the electric supply to the heater at the circuit breaker — watch the pilot light go out to ensure no more gas remains.</p>
<p>We provide FREE in-home Energy Consultations to evaluate your current system and help you choose the best water heater for your home. Hooking your tankless heater up to a solar system yields the best energy savings and reduces water heating expenses by 50%-80%. The Rinnai line of tankless hot water heaters feature indoor and outdoor models. But if you don't have a gas line into the house and have to use an electric unit, existing wiring may have to be upgraded.</p>
<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Woodland CA</h3>
<p>When a tap, shower, or appliance is turned on, cold water passes through the tankless water heater where it's heated by either a gas-fired burner or electric coils. The average household spends between $400 and $600 per year on water heating. If you desire a commercial tankless water heater for the cost-savings, we will work with you to find the best model for your application. Long recognized in Europe and Asia as a major energy- and space-saving solution, tankless water heaters have begun to make significant inroads in the North American market.</p>
<p>Check for leaks by turning on the gas supply valve and brushing a soapy water solution onto the gas union and all gas joints. Not only are they highly efficient, but they can also save you money by heating water only on-demand. Used for decades in Europe where living space is at a premium, tankless water heaters are a safe and reliable way to use less energy. What can go wrong: A single tankless heater may not have sufficient capacity to supply hot water to multiple locations at the same time.</p>
<p>You need to make sure you are upgrading to a tankless water heater that operates on the same type of energy source. Licensed plumbers know how to install a gas water heater without creating a potentially dangerous situation (and how to install electric water heater without getting electrocuted in the process). Always replace the dielectrics when installing a new water heater. Professional installation, which we recommend unless you are an experienced do-it-yourselfer, should cost about $150, part included.</p>

<p>It is so quick to heat and be replaced that you never seem to run out of hot water. Tank water heaters are a standard type of water heater. The tankless water heating system seems to be the best option as it significantly saves time and energy. Like our other services, your new water heater will be covered by our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee for a year. This heat from the pilot flame causes a tiny electrical signal to be sent to the control valve, telling the control valve that there is a flame present so it's OK to let the gas through to the main burner when the thermostat calls for heat.</p>
<p>Let us install your tankless water heater and keep your plumbing running smoothly. Gas is fed to the burner through a gas control valve and thermostat switch that are usually located toward the bottom of the hot water storage tank. They have trouble with hard water: Hard water is bad for any water heater, but the effects of hard water will negatively affect a tankless system quicker as the sediment builds up in its lines.</p>
<p>Keep your water heater set to 120 degrees F as higher temperatures can increase sediment buildup in the tank. The next thing that you should consider if you are asking the question of when do you need a new water heater is the age of the system that you have in your home. Traditional tank water heaters can run on gas or electricity. Here at The Hot Water Company, we are taking every precaution necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and can actually serve our great customers without coming in contact with them at all, as most water heaters are located outside or in the garage.</p>
<p>The most popular brands of water heaters are reliable, affordable, have good value and are always available. While tankless water heaters run more efficiently than storage tank water heaters, replacing a tank water heater with a tankless can be expensive, and the payback time can be longer than the warranty. An undersized water heater may also be the problem if too much water is being used to heat it adequately.</p>
<p>From time to time, repairs are required to meet some common problems like lukewarm water, a small flow, or a leak. With tankless water heaters, there's no storage hot water tank to leak or break, thus reducing the risk of flooding. Before making repairs or purchasing a new water heater, check the nameplate on the side of your current unit. Heating your water can use a lot of energy. If steam or excessively hot water shoots out of faucets, or you hear boiling sounds inside the water heater, the appliance may not be shutting off at its set temperature.</p>
