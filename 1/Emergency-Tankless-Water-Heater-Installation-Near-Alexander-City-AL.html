<p>A tankless water heater provides water as it is needed. This saves you from needing to drain the entire water heater. While it's usually recommended to stick with a gas water heater if you're concerned about energy costs, it is possible to switch from a gas to an electric water heater in Las Vegas. We have a comprehensive selection of gas and electric tank water heaters offered in multiple sizes, all with excellent warranties and installation. Sure, I said it wasn't the only reason to make the change, but solar heaters are undoubtedly a wonderful green choice.</p>

The greater the desired Temperature Rise, the less Gallons per Minute of hot water can be produced. Our team of professionals is highly trained, knowledgeable, and experienced in all water heater installations and repairs. Such installation may result in an explosion or fire, but sometimes there may be no other choices.</p>
<p>Instead, when a flow-activated switch comes on, the heat exchanger turns on and heats the water as you need it. Tankless water heaters come in point-of-use styles like a coffee pot plumbed into the water system, or as whole-house units. Call (805) 499-0448 today to begin your expert AC repair, installation, or replacement. Tank style water heaters generally last about ten years.
