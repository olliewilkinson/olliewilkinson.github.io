Smith lightweight and easy-to-install electric tankless water heaters can be mounted in small or tight spaces throughout your home. Worse yet… you arrive home after a nice evening out only to find your home or garage is flooded because from your water heater leaking. For the purpose of cost and efficiency, it's important to have an appropriately sized hot water storage tank. These units are a good choice for any household whose demand for hot water is not more than two points at a time.</p>
<p>For a standard 40 gallon water heater you now only have about 34 gallons.
