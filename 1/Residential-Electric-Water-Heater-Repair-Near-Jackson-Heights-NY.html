<h2>Water Heater Services Jackson Heights New York</h2>
<p>Electric tankless hot water heaters come in very useful sizes - from something that looks like a loaf of bread to some the size of a PC. All have the capability of providing instant hot water on demand. Tankless water heaters are all the rage. As for the cold water side, if you have a shut off valve that is in good shape, you'll want to cut below that so that you can keep the water on to the rest of the house and if not, you'll have to shut off the water at the main and I suggest installing a new valve while you have this all opened up. These standby losses may represent 10% to 20% of a home's yearly water heating expense.</p>
<p>Free in-home estimates to replace your water heater. Before you purchase a water heater, it's also a good idea to estimate its annual operating costs and compare those costs with other less or more energy-efficient models. At a $180 yearly cost reduction, it will take 3.5 to 8 years to recover the additional expense and begin to save money. The fact that it costs significantly more to purchase and install is the only danger preventing everyone from enjoying the energy efficiency of a tankless gas water heater.</p>
<p>Whether you repair or replace, water heaters will perform better and last longer if you flush the tank once a year to remove sediment. If you are not 100% confident installing an electric water heater, Lowe's recommends that you hire a professional. Gas units are often a little higher costs for installation because of the venting required. If the water starts out in the middle of the heater for instance, it will leave the heater after only being in the pipe for half the time it would need to reach full temperature.</p>
<h3>Affordable Tankless Water Heater Replacement Jackson Heights</h3>
<p>We've got over 30 years of experience with tankless water heater installation, tankless water heater replacement and tankless water heater repairs. Many homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters in order to save on water, energy, money and space. 1)When a hot water faucet is opened this causes water to flow through the tankless unit. Rheem water heaters are available in multiple sizes and with multiple warranties, with energy-efficiency claims that vary by size.</p>
<p>Electric tankless water heaters assist in reducing the energy consumption within your home by not having to heat water in storage tanks that goes unused. Longer Lifespan: Generally, a tankless system will last a lot longer than the water heaters with tanks, because they're not in constant contact with water. This problem can be solved by using a demand hot water pump, which in combination with the tankless heater can get your hot water to you at less than half the time it would take running the faucet full blast, and the pump doesn't run water down the drain, so you save not only time, but water as well.</p>

If there's a problem with the heater's thermocouple, the problem is critical because it's actually a safety instrument that detects when the pilot light is on.

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
<p>For over 30 years, we've been the go-to water heater installation company in the area, and we strive to maintain our excellent reputation. This is because the hot water sitting in the pipes will eventually cool down if you don't use it. Tankless water heaters come in a variety of sizes for different applications, such as a whole-house tankless water heater, a source for a remote bathroom or hot tub, or as a boiler to provide hot water for a home heating system.</p>
<p>It's important to get a large enough tankless water heater to make sure that adequate hot water flow is available. If you use a lot of hot water, around 86 gallons per day, tankless water heaters are only 8% to 14% more efficient since they are running more often. Water Heaters Only Inc has been specializing in water heater replacement since 1968. Slide the new water heater into place, recut or extend the old tubing to meet the new, and solder the tubing together using copper slip couplings.</p>
<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there. If there is adequate electrical service and room in the breaker panel, electric tankless is a great option. The heating element in the unit heats it up to the temperature that is desired. Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Energy , heating water accounts for about 30 percent of a family's energy bills. They are larger in size compared to the storage tank heaters. When you and your system are ready, we'll oversee the delivery and installation of your new tankless water heater. If you smell gas, or a pungent rotten egg smell near your gas water heater, you should get everyone out of house and get in touch with the local gas company.</p>
