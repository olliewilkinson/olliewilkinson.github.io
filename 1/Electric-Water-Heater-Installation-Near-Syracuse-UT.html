A water heater that's right for you. Connect with dedicated hoses the hot water outlet and the cold water inlet via the pressure relief valve.

<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair Syracuse</h3>
<p>Admittedly, your old water heater is one of the biggest contributors to that high energy bill, and replacing it could mean considerable savings. Tankless water heaters have become increasingly popular due to their efficiency and compact size. Several smaller units cannot produce enough hot water for simultaneous purposes in large families. As many homeowners look for ways to lower their energy costs, one area of improvement is water heating.</p>
<p>If you're hoping to gain an endless supply of hot water without paying a dollar extra to receive it, then a tankless water heater might be the best option for you. Trust Hunts for your hot water tank repairs and know that it will be fixed right the first time and backed by our warranty.

In general, these water heaters are a good idea for smaller to medium sized houses, as they are highly efficient.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are energy efficient compared to traditional water heating systems, as they do not work until a hot water faucet is turned on. Regular maintenance can keep your tankless unit going up to 20 years — twice as long as standard storage water heaters. That's because of their reputation for running more efficiently, an appealing characteristic given that heating water is the average U.S. home's second highest utility cost after heating and cooling the house itself.</p>
<p>Just call and ask us. (We have both plumbers and electricians) Our experts can repair your water heater and get the hot water flowing in your home again. This may be happening because the circuit breaker that controls the water heater has flipped off, the thermostat stopped working, or electrical elements are defective.

Contact a water damage company and your insurance agent to start the process right away because time is of the essence.</p>

Although there are various water heater types, the two most common are tank water heaters and tankless water heaters Both tank-type and tankless models can be either gas-fired or electric (although John Moore does not install electric tankless water heaters).</p>
<p>Because electric power is more expensive than gas, these units are better suited for smaller jobs. New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company. Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
