<h2>Water Heater Services Rowland North Carolina</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>

Unless you have two or more water heaters, hot water in some part of your house means that the water heater is working.</p>

When it comes to tankless water heaters there really is nothing we can't do and do really well. Removing your current water heater cost anywhere from $100 to $500. The most common issues that occur in regards to tankless water heaters are system overload, mineral buildup, flame failure, or an exhaust blockage.</p>
