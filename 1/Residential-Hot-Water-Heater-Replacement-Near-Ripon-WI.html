<p>Compact tankless water heaters only heat water when you need it. This type of heater uses gas burners or electric coils to heat water on demand. Plus you need a wye, not a T where the water heater and furnace connect. These units provide on demand” performance since they don't have a storage tank. Nevertheless, it's something just about everyone must deal with at some point or another because no water heating system lasts forever.</p>

In regards to the cost of operation, natural gas and propane water heaters are less expensive to operate than electric or oil units of the same size. Traditional water heaters have hot water sitting at the top of the tank ready to go. On a tankless unit, cold water enters the heat exchanger tubing and begins to be heated.</p>

Only gas can produce enough hot water for a large home. Contact us anytime you think your water heater needs repair service.
