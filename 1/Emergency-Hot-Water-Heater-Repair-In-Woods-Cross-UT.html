<h2>Water Heater Services Woods Cross Utah</h2>
<p>At Gary's Plumbing and Heating, we service all your water heating problems. The sentiment has also moved into the world of plumbing, where tankless water heaters have become popular for their ability to deliver hot water anytime it's needed. The first place to look would be the energy efficiency ratings of tank and tankless models. Tankless systems cost twice as much as traditional tank units, however because they only heat water only at the time it is being used, they are far more energy-efficient.</p>
<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call. A tank-style water heater expends energy around the clock to maintain the temperature of a 40 to 50-gallon water supply so that hot water is ready when it's needed. Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>
<p>Clean the pipes beforehand with steel wool if you want to reduce the amount of buildup in the water heater, but it is not required as there is only a little bit of deposit that could get into the heater from copper tubing. Water heaters must be properly maintained. We fix all makes and models—including both standard and tankless water heaters.
