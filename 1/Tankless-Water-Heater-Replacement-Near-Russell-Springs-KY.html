<h2>Water Heater Services Russell Springs Kentucky</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>This is because the flow of energy is easier to regulate with an electric connection, plus the pilot light has to be properly ignited with a gas connection. And no tanks means no hot water sitting unused, reducing your overall heating costs by hundreds of dollars. If it's too big, you may be spending more money than necessary to heat up the water within the tank. We keep water heaters stocked at TLC so we can replace your water heater day or night.</p>
<p>When a hot water tap is turned on, water from your pipes enters the water heater and passes through the heat exchanger. It provides you with enough hot water to wash your dishes and your clothes, to bathe and shower, and to heat the water for cleaning cabinets, mopping floors, washing your hair, and more. For the home that has an average consumption of hot water a 40 gallon tank is normally sufficient. Emergency Water and Gas Shut Off Valve - Also known as "WAGS".</p>
