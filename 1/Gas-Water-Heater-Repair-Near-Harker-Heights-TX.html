<h2>Water Heater Services Harker Heights Texas</h2>
<p>Thermal couple repair is probably the most common repair on a gas fired water heater. Most, if not all codes require that gas burning equipment be installed where they have enough air to "breathe". The type of fuel required will affect not only the operating costs but also the purchase price of your tankless water heater. If you currently have a water heater that's in fine condition but you are looking to upgrade to a new one, the plumbers at All About Plumbing & Septic are able to help you.</p>
<p>This is because the flow of energy is easier to regulate with an electric connection, plus the pilot light has to be properly ignited with a gas connection. And no tanks means no hot water sitting unused, reducing your overall heating costs by hundreds of dollars. If it's too big, you may be spending more money than necessary to heat up the water within the tank. We keep water heaters stocked at TLC so we can replace your water heater day or night.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are popular options for water heater replacements, and they're only going to become more popular as homeowners discover their numerous advantages. It could be as simple as adjusting the heat so the water gets hotter. When we manage an installation, we actually take the time to remove and drain your old unit before hauling it away. Tankless water heaters are usually powered with electricity or gas.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Harker Heights</h3>
<p>If you have any of these issues, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs or even a replacement.

Lower initial cost - A traditional water heater installation can be half as much as a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Solar water heaters are efficient but expensive. If you purchase a tankless heater by a good brand such as Bosch, Kenmore or American Water Heater, it can last as long as 20 years without being repaired or replaced. Sometimes they are called an in-line heater, as it only heats the water it needs as it passes through, and therefore energy is not wasted by heating extra water all day that is not in use. Knochelmann Service Experts Heating & Air Conditioning has skills to repair your water heater and have your household back to normal.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are compact heating units that provide hot water as it is needed and do not store hot water like traditional tank-type water heaters. Tankless hot water heaters are ideal for new homes and major renovations. The storage tank holds the heated water for household usage. A Tankless water heater is typically wall-mounted, requires less space, and is much higher in efficiency than standard types.</p>

<p>There are minor repairs that you can attempt for yourself if you know how to repair a water heating appliance. If these water heaters function in a cool environment (location), they'll work harder in the winter months, driving your gas or electric bills even higher during the cold winter. The temperature set on the control determines how hot the coils become, how quickly the water moves across the coils, and how hot the water will be when it comes out of the tap.</p>
<p>You need to make sure you are upgrading to a tankless water heater that operates on the same type of energy source. Licensed plumbers know how to install a gas water heater without creating a potentially dangerous situation (and how to install electric water heater without getting electrocuted in the process).
