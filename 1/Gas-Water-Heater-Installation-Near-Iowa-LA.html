<p>Hot water heater problems can occur any time. It is important to know what you are looking for and what your capabilities are when attempting to deal with any hot water heater repair.

Our expert team of licensed plumbers will be able to diagnose the issue with your water heater and determine if it can be fixed with a repair or it needs a replacement.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
<p>If you're having problems with your existing water heater—or you need to get a new one—don't try to deal with it alone.
