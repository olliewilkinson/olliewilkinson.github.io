<h2>Water Heater Services Brookville Ohio</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>

For many people, having to repair their water heater is an issue that will sneak up on them.</p>
<p>With a tank-style hot water heater, water is heated in a tank and stored until it is needed. Electric water heaters are powered by standard electricity to heat and cool the water that flows to your tubs, showers, sinks, dishwasher, and washing machine.
