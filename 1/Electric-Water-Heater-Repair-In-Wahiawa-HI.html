We will show you the potential causes and after you enter your model number into the search field, we'll sell you the exact part that fits your water heater and show you how to install it. Light the pilot light in the new water heater and adjust the temperature setting. The water that flows through the pipes isn't halted at any point to be heated so you may have to set the thermostat a bit higher to get the temperature of water you want for your shower, bath or dishwasher.</p>

If you have a small drip or a leak coming out of your water heater, it's very important to get a plumber over right away.</p>
<p>Removal - Most plumbers will charge between $250 and $500 to take the old water heater out and take it away for proper disposal. That's where an annual tank flush can come in handy, as it can remove these harmful sediments and ensure that your hot water tank is working at maximum efficiency. Kids won't be attracted to the inviting spigot, since the unit looks more like a computer than a hot water processor.
