Tankless water systems are popular for the simple reasons that tankless systems provide you with a virtually endless supply of hot water both where and when you need it.

If you can and choose to do the job yourself, you should know how to shut off the water to your house (see How to Shut Off the Water to Fixtures ) and how to cut into and connect new fittings and pipes to your supply pipes (if you have copper pipes, see Cutting & Joining Copper Pipe ).</p>

<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler.

Solar, tankless systems and fuel oil systems, however, can cost as much as $1,000 or more to install.</p>
