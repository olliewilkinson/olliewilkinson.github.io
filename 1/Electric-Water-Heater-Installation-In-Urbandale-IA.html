<p>These are not required for gas instant hot water systems. Electric water heaters are high-voltage (240-volt) appliances that are dangerous to work with when the power is on. Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box). Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>
<p>Your water heater doesn't start up: A failure to ignite or to turn at all can indicate a number of problems with your water heater, from the thermostat to the electric ignition. Our Austin plumbers constantly receive calls from individuals who notice that their water heater might have a problem. If your electric water heater isn't working the first thing to do is check your breaker or fuse box. Furthermore, tankless systems last nearly twice as long as traditional water heaters - up to 20 years or more.</p>

<p>A hot water heater is the thirty to fifty gallon tank tactfully closeted in your kitchen, bathroom, or some other well-concealed space. In water heater tanks, one of the most common problems is corrosion. Hot water heaters work hard day in, day out — until they don't. Only heats water when you need it, so energy isn't wasted for hot water that's not needed right away. Many people try to cut water usage in an effort to reduce this lost energy, but they don't realize that the heat is still generated throughout the day, whether or not they actually use the hot water in the tank.</p>
<p>If your main water heater is broken, but one of the above conditions exist, the dishwasher will have hot water despite the broken main water heater.

When a new water heater is needed, most people hire a technician or plumbing company for installation to handle the job.

<p>If you can't confidently say you know how to install a water heater you really need to use caution. As opposed to waiting for a storage tank to fill with enough hot water for use, tankless water heaters provide a constant supply of it.

<p>You need to make sure you are upgrading to a tankless water heater that operates on the same type of energy source. Licensed plumbers know how to install a gas water heater without creating a potentially dangerous situation (and how to install electric water heater without getting electrocuted in the process). Always replace the dielectrics when installing a new water heater. Professional installation, which we recommend unless you are an experienced do-it-yourselfer, should cost about $150, part included.</p>

May reduce water heating bills by as much as 30 percent. The additional insulation to improve energy efficiency makes these water heaters wider.</p>

Your tankless water heater can provide you with endless hot water for years to come with the right repair and maintenance from Central Plumbing. What this example shows us, though, is that the upfront costs of a whole-home tankless gas water heater is roughly 2 to 2.5 times more expensive than a high-efficiency gas storage water heater and a high-efficiency is less expensive to own than a conventional gas storage water heater.</p>
<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
