<h2>Water Heater Services Savannah Georgia</h2>
<p>There are several reasons for and against installing an electric tankless water heater.

Having an incorrect setting can cause your water to be too cold, too hot, or cause your heating elements to work constantly. If your tank is gas powered, you'll find gas connections below the tank at the pilot light. The idea behind this type of water heater is to reduce wasted energy by heating the water as it runs through the pipe instead of keeping it in a tank and spending energy to keep it at one temperature twenty four hours a day.</p>
<p>There are many components to a gas or electric water heater that may require adjustment to restore hot water to your home. The average water heater has a lifespan of 12 years. But those perks may not be enough for some people to offset the extra purchase cost and installation expense. Electric tankless products do work in cold climates. If you have a small drip or a leak coming out of your water heater, it's very important to get a plumber over right away.</p>

<p>The water is heated by a couple of electric resistance elements that extend from the side of the tank into the middle of the water. There are times that the pipes cause the issue and not the water heater.
