While DIY repairs can save you some time and money, it can also be messy, and there's the risk of electrical exposure with certain repairs.

Gas hot water heaters have changed over the years as now most of them have a igniter for lighting the pilot and a gas valve with built in diagnostics. Many homes have galvanized steel or plastic (CPVC) water supply pipes. As time goes on, your water heater naturally starts to fill itself with sediment at the bottom of the tank.</p>
<p>This is a type of heater that provides hot water only as it is needed. In order for the top element to have voltage and heat the water, the temperature of the water in the top of the tank must be lower than the temperature setting of the top thermostat.
