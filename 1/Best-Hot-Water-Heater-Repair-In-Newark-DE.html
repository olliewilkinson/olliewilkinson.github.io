Your water heater's size is determined by how much warm water you use and what kind of heater you select. Other terms for Tankless are Combination, Combi Boilers, Continuous Flow, Inline, Flash, On-Demand or Instant-On Water heaters. Tankless water systems are popular for the simple reasons that tankless systems provide you with a virtually endless supply of hot water both where and when you need it. With old style tank systems, heated water can sit for long periods of time, generating hard-water scale and using costly energy to maintain water temperatures.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement Newark</h3>
<p>A hot water heater is the thirty to fifty gallon tank tactfully closeted in your kitchen, bathroom, or some other well-concealed space. In water heater tanks, one of the most common problems is corrosion. Hot water heaters work hard day in, day out — until they don't. Only heats water when you need it, so energy isn't wasted for hot water that's not needed right away. Many people try to cut water usage in an effort to reduce this lost energy, but they don't realize that the heat is still generated throughout the day, whether or not they actually use the hot water in the tank.</p>
<p>While scale can shorten the life of the heating element, you don't need to invest in fancy features to get a water heater that lasts. Tankless heaters can be installed underneath sinks or in small closets as well as in traditional hot water tank enclosures. As a result, their expected equipment life is possibly longer - more than 20 years, compared with 10 - 15 years for traditional heaters. We have a range of gas and electric tank water heaters offered in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>

The main advantage of tankless water heaters is that they are energy efficient and save you money over the long term. A main unit could be repositioned to shorten the run to some of the most used outlets while a smaller electric on-demand heater could be use to supplement in a bedroom or utility room. Plus, many tankless units, even those that run on gas, require an electrical connection to operate, which may require an additional supply line to be installed.</p>
