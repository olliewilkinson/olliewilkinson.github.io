Units with increased energy efficiency and upgraded features, like hybrid models, may also raise the unit's price. Our proficient plumbing specialists can complete any water heater repair that comes our way in Kingston. There are two types of tankless water heaters: electric and gas-fired.

<p>With hot water pipes adequately insulated with materials like foam pipe insulation sleeves, your plumber can help your home become more energy efficient. Similar to gas-fired tank-type systems, gas-fired tankless systems include a vent that removes any by-products created during the combustion process. Typically, tankless water heaters provide hot water at a rate of 2-5 gallons (7.6-15.2 liters) per minute. If your electric hot water heater is slow to heat, runs out of hot water faster than it used to, or doesn't deliver any hot water at all, there's a 90 percent chance that simply replacing one or both of the heating elements will solve the problem.</p>

<p>Like all other plumbing systems in your home, regular maintenance can ensure your home's hot water heater continues to perform at its very best. Whenever removing electric elements on an electric water heater, be sure that the electricity is turned off. Tankless units last about 5-10 years longer than conventional units. Even if you are replacing your water heater with a conventional one, the installation process is not as simple as it might seem.</p>
<p>The first thing to check is for any leaks or standing water near your water heater. If the pilot light is out, follow the instructions posted on the water heater or the details below here to relight the pilot light. Reconnect the wire that was removed from the heating element to perform the resistance check in the previous steps. Visit the pages on different types of water heaters (linked above) for more on estimating costs.</p>
<p>Tankless heaters take up less space compared to the space of a 20 or 80-gallon tank. Single point tankless units can be installed on the interior or exterior of the building near the water use point and no more than 50 ft. from an adjacent power source (typically requiring 220 volts) if using an electric heater. Typically, tankless water heaters, which heat water only when you need it, cost more but can save about 25 percent of annual water heating costs, on average.</p>
