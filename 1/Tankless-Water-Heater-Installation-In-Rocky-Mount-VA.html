This will help to prevent sediment and scale build up in your water heater keeping it in the best shape possible. For a tankless water heater that makes 40 gallons or less of hot water every day, owners enjoy about 34% more energy efficiency over traditional heaters For those who utilize a lot of hot water (more than 80 gallons) every day, this efficiency is around 14 percent.</p>
<p>When you are ready for your shower you push a button and the pump sends the heated water from your water heater to your fixture more quickly than if you run the shower at full blast, and the pump shuts off when the hot water reaches it. Thus you save time, water, energy, and money. Tank heaters must always keep water warm after heating it. This process means that they continuously cycle on and off to keep water warm.</p>

Turn off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the problem. These steps may have a more immediate effect upon your energy usage than installing a tankless water heater will.</p>
