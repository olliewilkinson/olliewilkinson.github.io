Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits. You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>
<p>Flow rate- Flow rate is how many gallons of hot water a tankless water heater can produce in 1 minute. Tankless water heaters operate by turning on as a hot water tap or appliance is activated, heating the water through a heat exchanger as it is moved to the faucet, dishwasher, washing machine, or shower head.

The type of water heater you choose directly affects your water heating costs. If you've had issues with hot water supply for as long as you've had the heater, your water heater's tank might not be big enough to supply the hot water you need.</p>
<p>A recirculating pump will push the cold water in your pipes back to the water heater, saving water and making sure you have hot water as soon as you turn on the tap. These heaters are versatile enough to be used for a variety of purposes including bathrooms and hot tubs, for appliances like dishwashers and washing machines, and as a booster for solar water heaters. If your current system is outdated, there will be other costs such as replacing the ductwork or plumbing.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are compact heating units that provide hot water as it is needed and do not store hot water like traditional tank-type water heaters. Tankless hot water heaters are ideal for new homes and major renovations. The storage tank holds the heated water for household usage.

<p>Age: If your unit is older, and especially if it requires repairs or replacement parts to keep it functioning, it can be more cost-effective to install a new unit. Frequent breakdowns are a good indicator that it may be time for a full water heater replacement. Tank-style heaters don't produce hot water instantly either but since they have a supply ready to go and don't need to kick on, it reaches the outlet more quickly.</p>
<p>Essential, the pressure relief valve protects the water heater against possible overpressure. Because of the way that tankless water heaters heat water, you can often end up with a slug of cold water when hot water is turned on, off, then on again. Eventually, it can burn out the heating elements in your water heater, shortening its lifespan. Open several hot water outlets for a couple of minutes to purge any air from the pipes and water heater.</p>

In addition to providing you with a wide selection of tankless water heaters at your local Ferguson, you can also buy tankless water heaters online. The distance from the water heater to the faucet will determine the time it takes for hot water to reach the faucet. Tankless units let you regain space in your home because they're mounted on the wall instead of installing in corners, closets, basements and utility rooms.</p>
<p>More expensive low-density elements are usually folded back like the one shown in Photo 5. These provide the same amount of heat but spread out over a larger surface area, which lowers the surface temperature, making them less prone to mineral buildup. Keep a distance of 24″ between the combustibles, the water heater, and the output hot water pipe. Colder climates mean colder incoming groundwater temperature, resulting in a need for more energy to heat the water to your desired temperature.</p>
<p>Water heaters can consume a great amount of energy, so by increasing your water heaters efficiency you can decrease your energy costs. Naturally, then, extending the life of your water heater and preventing any unexpected break downs is a priority.
