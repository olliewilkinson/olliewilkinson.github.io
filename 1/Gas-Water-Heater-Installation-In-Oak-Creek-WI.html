<h2>Water Heater Services Oak Creek Wisconsin</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>The recommended water heater setting of about 115-120 degrees, it keeps your water heater from overheating and save a lot of electricity. Trying to install a water heater yourself can be dangerous and end up costing more than hiring a professional. All forms of flammable material must be kept far away from the heater, while construction components hidden in the wall like wooden supports must be properly insulated from heat in order not to weaken or even ignite as the heater is used over time.</p>
<p>You can trust the experts at BGE HOME to help you select the water heater that fits your budget and will help you achieve your energy savings goal. The cheap price of gas that once made a 65 percent efficiency rating for home heating needs a bargain has changed.
