<p>Purchasing a hot water for the home is something that a lot of people will have to do in their lives. A. Smith lightweight and easy-to-install electric tankless water heaters can be mounted in small or tight spaces throughout your home. Worse yet… you arrive home after a nice evening out only to find your home or garage is flooded because from your water heater leaking. For the purpose of cost and efficiency, it's important to have an appropriately sized hot water storage tank. These units are a good choice for any household whose demand for hot water is not more than two points at a time.</p>
<p>Since a tankless unit only runs when hot water is being used, it can be left on with no waste or risk and no worries.

<p>To avoid flooding from tank failure, Bill Smith Plumbing & Heating offers alarm and cold water shut-off valve options. Our experienced technicians are equipped and trained for electric water heater repair. When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution. Traditional water heaters work by heating and storing a set amount of water in a tank. Turning on hot water throughout the home activates the heater, even if the pilot light is not on, so you are able to check the pipes for leaks much more easily.</p>
<p>Most tankless water heaters have a life expectancy of more than 20 years. Even with a tankless a.k.a. instantaneous water heater, you won't have instant hot water whenever you open the kitchen faucet or another outlet. The average energy savings and additional lifespan make tankless heaters a viable option for many homes. Generally as your heater ages sediment build-up will occur, decreasing the amount of hot water that the heater can produce.</p>

If a gas water heater is incorrectly vented, hot gases can present a fire danger inside the walls. Until, of course, the water heater suddenly stops working, and all that hot water that once flowed freely is nothing but a near-freezing stream — not something you're thrilled to take a shower in.</p>
<p>Electric tankless models may require an upgrade of the home's electrical capacity. These units also require tankless water heater replacement less frequently than traditional units. We can service the vast majority of water heater makes and models. The gas-fired type works very much the same as the electric heater in terms of sensing water flow and instantly heating it.
