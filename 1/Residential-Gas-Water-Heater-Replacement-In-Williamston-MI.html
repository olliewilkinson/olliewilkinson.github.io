<p>Your water heater is your last defense for dealing with freezing cold water, which is why you should always stay on top of regular maintenance and care. Whether it's powered by electricity or natural gas, your water heater isn't built to last forever.

<p>The only bigger percentage is heating and cooling costs. Tankless water heaters are heaters which work dynamically, heating water up as you request it, so no energy gets wasted storing any heated water, there's no bulk since the tankless water heater is just a small box, and you'll have no difficulties concealing it under a sink or behind a piece of furniture for example. We want you to know exactly what we're doing as we do it, both so you can be informed during the installation process and so you can properly maintain and understand your unit after it's installed.</p>
