<h2>Water Heater Services Kew Gardens New York</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>

Each hot water heater comes with a digital control pad that allows you to control the water temperature for various water outlets in your home or business. There are many different types of water heaters on the market.</p>
<p>The truth behind the myth is that the only part of the water heater which necessitates replacement is a leak in the tank itself.
