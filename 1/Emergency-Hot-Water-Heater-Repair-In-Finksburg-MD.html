<h2>Water Heater Services Finksburg Maryland</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>Age- Most water heaters last roughly 10 - 15 years. A plumbing inspector will come to your place and look at the installation to make sure that the work was done properly.

For many people, having to repair their water heater is an issue that will sneak up on them.</p>
<p>On a gas unit, also shut off the gas and unplug the electrical supply or turn off the circuit breaker.

Flow rate: Flow rate refers to how many gallons of hot water the unit can provide in a minute.
