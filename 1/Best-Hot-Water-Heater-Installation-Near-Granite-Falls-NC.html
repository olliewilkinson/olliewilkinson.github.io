<h2>Water Heater Services Granite Falls North Carolina</h2>
<p>There are several reasons for and against installing an electric tankless water heater. No two brands of tankless heaters are exactly alike, and an improperly installed unit will more than likely underperform. Call (855) 982-2028 to schedule your water heater repair service. Having an incorrect setting can cause your water to be too cold, too hot, or cause your heating elements to work constantly. If your tank is gas powered, you'll find gas connections below the tank at the pilot light. The idea behind this type of water heater is to reduce wasted energy by heating the water as it runs through the pipe instead of keeping it in a tank and spending energy to keep it at one temperature twenty four hours a day.</p>
<p>The water heater produces loud popping or cracking noises during use. So when you're experiencing issues, such as not enough hot water or no hot water at all, your first response may be just to replace it altogether. A tankless water heater usually requires a 1-inch gas pipe from the meter to the water heater. We take the guesswork out of water heater replacement. Foam pipe insulation minimizes heat loss through hot-water pipes.</p>
<p>You'll be more than pleased with the results of a Show Plumbing tankless water heater installation, and you'll enjoy the system's benefits for years to come. The best heaters are those that have the best amount of insulation built into them. Permits are required on most water heater installs and pricing varies by province, city and municipality. Wait a few minutes to see if the water heater burner ignites. Or if your water heater is slow to heat or runs out of hot water faster than it used to, you may be able to make a quick fix by replacing the heating element.</p>
<h3>Affordable Hot Water Heater Repair Granite Falls</h3>
<p>By nature of the design, the Tempra® is nearly 100% efficient; converting 100% of the electrical energy it consumes into heat. When a hot water faucet is turned on, water flows through the tankless water heater. The burners can become dirty and clogged, which will cause them to have trouble firing, and you'll notice this by a drop in hot water temperature in the house. This thorough video, by Ron Hazelton, explains how a failing conventional water heater can cause debris in your water that clogs faucet aerators, shower heads, and other water-using devices.</p>
<p>When you are ready for your shower you push a button and the pump sends the heated water from your water heater to your fixture more quickly than if you run the shower at full blast, and the pump shuts off when the hot water reaches it. Thus you save time, water, energy, and money. Tank heaters must always keep water warm after heating it. This process means that they continuously cycle on and off to keep water warm.</p>
<p>However, if you're considering an electric tankless water heater, you'll need to make sure your home's electric panel can handle the added load. The first of course is there is no storage tank to run out of hot water. For those who have gas water heaters, the problem could lie in a gas leak.

<p>With a standard unit you have to keep reheating the water over and over again, day after day, and year after year but a tankless hot water heater gives you an endless supply and uses about 50% less electricity. In regards to the cost of operation, natural gas and propane water heaters are less expensive to operate than electric or oil units of the same size. Traditional water heaters have hot water sitting at the top of the tank ready to go. On a tankless unit, cold water enters the heat exchanger tubing and begins to be heated.</p>

<p>If you're anything like the average homeowner, you use your water heater daily. Along with the insulated foam, water heaters are now made with a glass liner inside to prevent corrosion from the minerals in the water. Installing a gas tankless water heater involves mounting the unit, connecting gas and water lines, and installing a flue. Electric water heaters tend to only last 8 to 10 years before they need to be replaced.</p>
<p>Because electric power is more expensive than gas, these units are better suited for smaller jobs. New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company. Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
