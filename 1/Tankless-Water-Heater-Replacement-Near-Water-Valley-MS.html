Another advantage is that tankless heaters have a longer life span those ordinary heaters.</p>
<p>This makes tankless water heaters take longer to deliver hot water. Although hot water heaters can differ from model to model, they all operate on similar ideas.

They can range from the usual water heaters that simply store a tank of hot water for the household's use.</p>
