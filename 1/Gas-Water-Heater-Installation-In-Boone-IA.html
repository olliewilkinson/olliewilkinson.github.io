<p>A hot water heater is the thirty to fifty gallon tank tactfully closeted in your kitchen, bathroom, or some other well-concealed space. In water heater tanks, one of the most common problems is corrosion. Hot water heaters work hard day in, day out — until they don't. Only heats water when you need it, so energy isn't wasted for hot water that's not needed right away. Many people try to cut water usage in an effort to reduce this lost energy, but they don't realize that the heat is still generated throughout the day, whether or not they actually use the hot water in the tank.</p>
<p>When you are ready for your shower you push a button and the pump sends the heated water from your water heater to your fixture more quickly than if you run the shower at full blast, and the pump shuts off when the hot water reaches it. Thus you save time, water, energy, and money. Tank heaters must always keep water warm after heating it. This process means that they continuously cycle on and off to keep water warm.</p>

If you notice several of the above symptoms it's likely your hot water heater is failing and it needs to be repaired or replaced. Although they can be a bit more expensive than the traditional models, the benefits you have on the tankless is satisfactory compare to the traditional water heater.</p>
<p>Most tankless water heaters can be repaired and have parts exchanged as well, so replacing the entire water heater every 6-8 years is a thing of the past.

<p>A booster is a highly useful device that can help your small heater act like a larger one, and it can even save you energy and space in your home.
