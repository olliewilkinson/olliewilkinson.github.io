<h2>Water Heater Services Gulf Shores Alabama</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>If a water heater is installed without a T&P valve (temperature and pressure relief valve) it may explode. Tankless water heaters are not measured on the capacity of water they hold but on how many gallons of hot water they can produce per minute.
