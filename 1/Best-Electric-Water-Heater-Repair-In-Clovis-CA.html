<h2>Water Heater Services Clovis California</h2>
<p>Water heater maintenance is one of the most important yet overlooked things home owners need to be aware of. Whether residing in a fairly new or older dwelling, it is very important that you inspect the appliance at regular intervals and make sure that it is working properly. You generally have to install a tank water heater indoors, as they cannot tolerate harsh weather conditions. There are several ways that you can benefit from having a tankless water heater installed. It should be noted that, for sizing purposes, the typical worst-case scenario (the middle of winter) should be assumed for the incoming groundwater temperature to ensure adequate hot-water availability year-round.</p>
<p>Tankless units have an average lifespan about twice that of conventional water heaters — 20 years or more. Call us today to schedule service for your water heater. One very good way of increasing the efficiency of your gas heater is by adding an insulation jacket. For all water heaters, life expectancy will depend on local variables such as water chemistry and homeowner maintenance.” For the purpose of this example, we'll assume both the tankless water heater and the storage water heater will each last 15 years.</p>
<p>And obviously, tankless water heaters take up much less space than the hulking behemoth of an old fashioned storage water heater. Our water heater repair will fix problems with any make and type of burners and other heating parts. Request us today for a free estimate on installing a new unit. Environmentally Friendly: Improved efficiency also leads to a reduced carbon footprint, making a tankless water heater installation a great move to make your home greener.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair Clovis</h3>
<p>At Epic Plumbing, we specialize in tankless water heater services to benefit our customers for the long haul. Changing to a tankless system like the Tempra® eliminates these problems and results in typical savings of at least 15 - 20% on the hot water portion of your electric bill. Never attempt to do it without first reading all the instructions that can with your particular tankless water heater. While you can help prolong the life of your water heater with annual maintenance, chances are you'll need to have the pre-existing tank replaced with a new one if you occupy a given residence for more than eight years.</p>
<p>If your building inspector finds a non-direct vent heater installed in a confined space, you will probably be told to add 2 new penetrations through the wall (known as high-and-low venting) or you will be told to remove it until it conforms to the code requirements. Heating water amounts to nearly 20% of a home's energy costs, so making sure you have a reliable water heater helps you save energy and money.</p>
<p>Get your water heater flushed out regularly to keep it running well. The only greater percentage is heating and cooling costs. Tankless units only operate when you need hot water, thereby reducing energy consumption and costs by up to 35%. This gets to one of my colleague's concerns: how long it takes for a tankless water heater to deliver hot water to its final destination. Upgrading to an energy efficient water heater will save a great deal of money over the life of the unit.</p>
<p>Not every house or business is going to use the same energy source to run their appliances, which is why it's so great that tankless water heaters can either be electric or gas. However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>
<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Clovis CA</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters may require more time to install depending on the size of your plumbing pipes and electric capacity. If you have had your water heater for over 10 years and it is starting to break down more often, then we may recommend a replacement. We are guaranteed to deliver the best customer experience for any plumbing, HVAC, electric, or roofing service you need. Examine the internal workings of a typical tankless unit.</p>
<p>If so, a tankless water heater may be a good option for your home and your family. A tankless system on the other hand doesn't store water, but rather heats it only when you need it. It does this through a design of super-heated coils. If your water heater is leaking or isn't heating your water well enough, call today. Draining the water heater is easy but be sure to get it started first since it will take a while to drain off and no one wants to carry water heater up a flight of stairs while there's still water in it. It makes it heavy and will more than likely create a mess along the way.</p>
<p>In addition to installing your new tankless water heater, we offer tankless water heater replacement service. If it's a conventional storage-tank water heater nearing the end of its 10 to 13-year life, replacement is obvious: New models are up to 20% more efficient and can save up to $700 in energy costs over the life of the unit. The installation cost for a tankless water heater is usually between $1,470 and $2,500.</p>

<p>Also, the government offers a 30% tax credit on the cost of installation for solar-powered water heating systems. At Water Heaters Only, Inc. Air Engineers Service Experts can help you use less hot water and lessen water heating costs with ENERGY STAR-rated models, installing low-flow fixtures and suggesting other energy-efficiency enhancements. You don't have to drain the tank to replace a thermostat. If you have low hot water pressure throughout the house or in an entire area (such as a bathroom), make sure there are no partially-closed valves on the hot water pipes that serve them.</p>
<p>8. A good indicator for both electric and gas heaters is the sacrificial anode rod. Your water heater is under constant stress to deliver enough hot water for your family. There are some less common causes that can make your electric water heater not as effective or efficient as it used to be. A water leak could be the cause as to why the hot water doesn't reach the showerhead and faucets. A cold climate can push tankless heaters right up to the limits of their capabilities.</p>
<p>Keep your water heater set to 120 degrees F as higher temperatures can increase sediment buildup in the tank. The next thing that you should consider if you are asking the question of when do you need a new water heater is the age of the system that you have in your home. Traditional tank water heaters can run on gas or electricity. Here at The Hot Water Company, we are taking every precaution necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and can actually serve our great customers without coming in contact with them at all, as most water heaters are located outside or in the garage.</p>
<p>So in a larger unit with multiple residents—or several units sharing a water heater—it can be tricky to get enough hot water for everyone to shower at the same time, or to do laundry and run the dishwasher at the same time. They are also ideal for families who have small homes and little room for bulky water heaters. Continuous Supply of Hot Water: You never have to worry about running out of hot water, so this option is perfect for homeowners with family members who take long steamy showers.</p>
<p>Next, your installer will mount the actual heating unit. For most households, the ideal hot water temperature is between 120 and 140 degrees. Instead of fighting over who gets the first shower in the morning, you don't have to worry about that with a new water heater. When you turn the hot water tap off the heat exchanger shuts down, saving energy and money. B&B Heating & Cooling are Homer Glen's tankless water heater specialists.</p>
