We can help you find the best water heater brand and then install it quickly and efficiently. But if a heater's Btu output can't keep up with demand, it will cut back the flow, or, worse case, deliver lukewarm water.</p>
<p>Not enough hot water - If you have limited hot water before it runs out, your heating elements are not properly doing their job. Most water heaters in New Mexico use natural gas and this means you have to burn combustible fuel to heat your water. You can achieve even greater energy savings of 27%-50% if you install a demand water heater at each hot water outlet. A conventional water heater burns money, as it is constantly heating water you don't use.</p>

A common misconception is that a water heater which has stopped functioning has to be replaced. With these units, you don't have to ever worry about a rusted tank that leaks. The power source for a tankless water heater needs to be readily accessible in the area where the tank is installed. Many people choose to simply use the same type that they are using presently, while others are influenced by the purchase price, the cost of running the heater over time, how energy efficient they are and how long it takes for the water to heat.</p>
<p>Outside of the GPM produced by most tankless heaters, there are a few heaters that go beyond the average, heating 7.5-11 GPM. Tankless water heaters feature an adjustable thermostat control. Don't pay to heat a tank full of water while away or worry about a tank water heater springing a leak.
