Tankless water heaters are rated to produce specific levels of heat. When you encounter a problem with your water heater, you aren't able to do any of these things, and that's a major disruption to your life.

This model is also referred to as a demand-type” or instant” water heater, and provides hot water by heating up cold water as it passes through the unit, as opposed to storing it in a tank like a traditional unit would.</p>
