<p>This also means that apart from calling the best plumbers like Vortex Plumbing Inc to help you out, you should inspect your heater from time to time. A water heater will typically last for between 10 and 20 years. If you have been using your heaters for this long, then it is probably more cost efficient to replace them than to just repair them.
