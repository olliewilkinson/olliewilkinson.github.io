<p>If your water system has a check valve or anti-siphon valve on the supply line, an expansion tank near the cold intake to the heater will likely be necessary. Most smaller units are installed near the point of usage, usually on the wall. Overall, the tankless gas water heaters are not as dangerous to life as the comparable standard tank-type units, although nothing is ever 100% assured. Don't think that your heater will continue to function perfectly for many decades, regardless of how modern and expensive yours is. Hot water heater can go for many years without needing repair, but they always eventually malfunction and need fixing or replacing.</p>
<p>Other repair needs include inadequate amount of hot water, strange noises coming from your unit or rusty colored water. With this method, and unlike conventional storage tanks, you would never run out of hot water. Drain out a gallon of water from the water heater, so it's not completely full at the plumbing connections on top. You may have looked up videos about how to install a water heater yourself, but our team cautions strongly against trying to DIY anything related to water heaters—particularly ones fueled by natural gas.</p>
<p>Many of the points above can be found in the instruction manuals of tankless gas heaters. Heat pump water heaters, also called hybrid electric water heaters , capture heat from the air or ground and transfer it to the water. A tankless water heater doesn't store water and heats it only when you need it. There are natural gas, electricity, propane heaters for you to choose from and they store from 20 to 120 gallons of water, depending on the size of the tank.</p>
