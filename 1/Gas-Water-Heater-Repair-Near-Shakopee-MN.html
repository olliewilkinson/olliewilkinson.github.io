<p>Water Heaters Only, Inc provides water heater service in San Jose and the surrounding and the surrounding communities including: Santa Clara, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Los Gatos, Saratoga, Morgan Hill and Monte Serreno. Tankless water heaters can be powered by both gas and electricity. If you have a gas water heater, turn off the gas shutoff valve in the supply line, too, before disconnecting it. If your gas water heater has a fan unit, unplug it. If your water heater's electric, unplug it. If there's a cable connection, switch off the power first, then disconnect the cable.</p>
<p>Using a traditional circulating pump will void the warranty on most tankless heaters, since they will cause the heater to turn on and off very frequently and far more than in typical household usage. If you know you have a recirculating loop for you water heater, it is a good idea to have a ball valve before the point where the loop connects to you water heater. Installing a tankless hot water heater while a new home is under construction makes good sense, especially for gas units that require more to make them operational.</p>
<p>When replacing a storage tank heater, the existing venting is often galvanized sheet metal that can oxidize or rust over a long period of time, if condensation collects inside it. The new tankless models are condensing units that are up to 92 percent more efficient, making their exhaust temperature only about 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Typically, tankless systems run on either electric or gas. On the other hand, storage water tank is best when you need hot water in the kitchen and bathrooms throughout the day.</p>
<p>When installing an exterior model you need to insulate the pipelines. A direct vent water heater is basically a sealed unit that has either two pipes or a concentric pipe pipe within pipe to suck in fresh air from outside the bathroom and also dispense exhaust gases outside. Cold weather Internal heaters keep components toasty down to −22-degrees F, but exposed water pipes must be insulated and wrapped in heat tape that turns on automatically in freezing temperatures.</p>
