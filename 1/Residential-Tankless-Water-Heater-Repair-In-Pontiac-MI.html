Get valuable information if you are considering replacing your existing water heater with a new tankless water heater. If your water heater is older and you need frequent repairs to keep it running smoothly, a new unit is likely a good idea.</p>

<h3>Emergency Hot Water Heater Replacement Pontiac</h3>
<p>A hot water heater is the thirty to fifty gallon tank tactfully closeted in your kitchen, bathroom, or some other well-concealed space. In water heater tanks, one of the most common problems is corrosion. Hot water heaters work hard day in, day out — until they don't. Only heats water when you need it, so energy isn't wasted for hot water that's not needed right away. Many people try to cut water usage in an effort to reduce this lost energy, but they don't realize that the heat is still generated throughout the day, whether or not they actually use the hot water in the tank.</p>
<p>Electric tank-type heaters utilize electrical-resistance heating elements located within the hot water storage tank to heat up the water within the tank. There is no need for a storage tank nor is there any energy wasted on heat loss with the tankless heating systems. Hot water heaters heat up the water supplied by your friendly utilities company, allowing you to do things like luxuriate in hot, candle-lit bathtubs, wash beautiful bone china, and keep yourself in a steady supply of clean underwear.</p>
<p>When you turn on a hot water faucet for the first time in a few hours, you may find yourself waiting impatiently for 30 seconds or more for the water to heat up. Once it starts coming out hot, it stays that way for a while. It is virtually impossible to repair a leaking hot water heater. Also, you will save money because the tankless water heater doesn't have a tank. However, the type of water heater you need for your home will greatly depend on what fuel type you already have.</p>

What's more, since their introduction in the United States in the 1990s, tankless heaters have become increasingly sophisticated, with features like built-in recirculating pumps (for instant” hot water), and wireless connectivity that tells you via smartphone exactly when a unit needs maintenance. In that scenario the person is left waiting for the tank of water to become heated to the set temperature.</p>

Generally as your heater ages sediment build-up will occur, decreasing the amount of hot water that the heater can produce.</p>
