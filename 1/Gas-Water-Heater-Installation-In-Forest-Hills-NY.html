<p>A gas hot water heater is the most common type you will find in most households. The best way to prevent emergency water heater repairs is to schedule regular maintenance for your system. Long lasting - Traditional tank water heating systems generally come with a warranty of up to 6 years. Here, the water is heated using either a gas burner or electric element as it passes through.

<p>If the water heater is too small, it will not provide enough hot water, and it will continuously run to create more hot water, which can cause the heater to fail prematurely and increase your energy bills. In order to check or replace a water heater element you will have to turn off the breaker serving the water heater circuit and remove the access cover on the water heater. A unit that requires cleaning, maintenance, or repair will struggle to meet your hot water demands.</p>
<p>In addition, you will benefit from adjusting your hot water temperature with the changing seasons to get the right temperature from the faucets. Manufacturers recommend that certified electricians or plumbers install tankless water heaters.
