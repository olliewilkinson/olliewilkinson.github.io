<h2>Water Heater Services El Cerrito California</h2>
<p>While the process of installing a tankless water heater isn't too difficult it is very different from the process of installing a standard tank water heater. Choosing the right team of plumbing professionals to maintain the flow of hot water to your home or business can be a challenging and stressful decision, which is why we're proud to have been the go-to professionals for many homes and businesses in High Point, NC since 1997. Electric water heater: Confirm that the circuit is off to the water heater, using a non-contact voltage tester, then disconnect the wiring connections and circuit cable from the water heater.</p>
<p>In most cases, if the water heater isn't heating water, the electrical elements inside it are not getting hot. If your hot water tank is over 15 years old, it's at the end of its natural life and you're better off getting a new one. You expect the best for your home, family and business, so it makes sense to trust the #1 selling gas tankless water heating brand in North America for all of your water heating needs.</p>
<p>Attach the vent pipe to the draft hood on the water heater (for gas water heaters only). A properly sized unit with sufficient air and gas inputs will provide efficient, on-demand hot water for your customers, leading to increased comfort and long-term savings. Now it's time to establish the cold (usually right side) and hot (usually left side) water connections. On a chilly day, it can take several minutes for hot water to travel from the hot water heater tank to your shower.</p>

<p>Gas-powered water heaters must vent out combustion fumes safely from the system.

Your Assured Comfort plumbing experts will thoroughly examine your water heater, and explain the issue and your repair or replacement options.</p>

<p>Compare the water heater's STCs for Zone 3 and for Zone 4 with the minimum requirements. Tankless water heaters last an average of 5-10 years longer than tank heaters. Tank water heaters store water and heat it on demand, while tankless water heaters heat the water using coils, without storing it. Tank water heaters are generally less expensive and can accommodate high-demand households, while tankless are more expensive up front, but can reduce your energy usage by around 30 per cent.</p>
