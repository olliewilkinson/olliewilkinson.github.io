The tankless heater compared to a conventional heater has unlimited hot water and can deliver for hours not limited by the tank's capacity.

<p>As the name suggests, a tankless water heater will directly heat the water without using a storage tank. The nationally recognized temperature for when scalding is significantly more likely to occur is 125° F, so it is generally not recommended to set the water heater higher than this. A tank water heater makes for an excellent water heater for many homes because of its relatively low upfront cost, its large hot water capacity, and its power.</p>
<p>If there is a similar problem with an electric tank-type water heater, no such explosion can occur. What it does is provide hot water on demand so you don't have to worry about the shower suddenly running cold. This water heater hangs on your wall and, instead of storing a large tank of water that is kept constantly hot-even when you're asleep or not at home-the tankless water heater produces hot water only when it's needed, as it's needed.</p>
<p>Comfortech Service Experts Heating & Air Conditioning can figure that out by helping you learn how much hot water you need and the flow rate of various fixtures and appliances in your home. Gas tankless water heaters need an exhaust vent to get rid of toxins they produce. Our proficient plumbing technicians can complete any water heater repair that comes our way in Shreveport.

Yes, one of the main reasons we get called out to a customer's house is their water heater has broken down and isn't supplying hot water anymore. This isn't an issue with tankless water heaters.
