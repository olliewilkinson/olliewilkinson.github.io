<h2>Water Heater Services Lansdale Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Homeowners love to save time and hassle and may be able to when it comes to working on a water heater. This is how it works: The hot water travels to your faucet produces endless supply of hot water as you need it.

<p>For a standard 40 gallon water heater you now only have about 34 gallons. The short delay between when the water starts to flow and when the heater kicks on causes a short burst of cold water before turning hot. Because methods for repairing the problem may depend on whether your water heater is gas or electric, these are discussed separately below. Electric Water Heater: For homes that are powered mainly by electricity, an electric water heater is likely the best option.</p>
<p>Due to their small size, tankless hot water heaters can be installed on most flush wall surfaces, as long as they have access to fuel and water lines (which should already be taken care of). A point-of-use (POU) electric tankless water heater should not be a problem in terms of amperage requirements. VIP Plumbing's team is ready to provide the service, repair or replace your existing boiler with a high-efficiency system from Navien or Weil-Mclain to improve your Solon home comfort and lower your utility and fuel costs.</p>

Water passes through the unit and is heated as needed, rather than continuously, saving on energy bills.</p>

<p>If the water heater is too small, it will not provide enough hot water, and it will continuously run to create more hot water, which can cause the heater to fail prematurely and increase your energy bills. In order to check or replace a water heater element you will have to turn off the breaker serving the water heater circuit and remove the access cover on the water heater. A unit that requires cleaning, maintenance, or repair will struggle to meet your hot water demands.</p>
<p>An expansion tank is a safety system for water that expands when it heats up. Most have a little room inside for expansion. A conventional water heater is a large, cylindrical tank with a heat exchanger inside. You will definitely want to have an expert take care of the installation if this is the first time a natural gas water heater is going to be installed in your house, as this will ensure that there is a large enough gap between the interior walls and the tank to prevent any possibility of fire.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Lansdale Pennsylvania 19446</h3>
<p>It is so quick to heat and be replaced that you never seem to run out of hot water. Tank water heaters are a standard type of water heater. The tankless water heating system seems to be the best option as it significantly saves time and energy. Like our other services, your new water heater will be covered by our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee for a year. This heat from the pilot flame causes a tiny electrical signal to be sent to the control valve, telling the control valve that there is a flame present so it's OK to let the gas through to the main burner when the thermostat calls for heat.</p>
<p>That means performing the manufacturer's recommended preventive water heater maintenance , periodically draining the tank (or lines) to remove damaging sediment and scale. Tank-type natural gas hot water heaters use ½” gas lines, while tankless hot water heaters require ¾” gas lines. Your circuit breaker might also have to be reviewed; the Electric Tankless Water Heater might also have to be installed on its own circuits.</p>
<p>If you ever see boiling water coming out of your faucet, or can see steam, you need to turn off your heater immediately and get a professional to inspect it. Boiling water usually means that the thermostat is broken and is overheating. We eliminate the stress and fear of replacing your water heater, by making the repair a fast, friendly, and comfortable experience. This means that the cause is somewhere between the water heater and the fixtures.</p>
<p>Low Capacity: The water heater that was originally installed in your home was not designed to keep up with a growing family and modern appliances. Many newer water heaters use a new electronic control valve called the Honeywell Smart Controller. Consumer Reports recently tested four electric and five gas whole-house tankless water heaters from such brands as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless to see how costs, performance, and energy use stack up against that of conventional storage tank water heaters.</p>
<p>The most common types of traditional and tankless water heaters seen in residential settings are either electric or gas-powered products. The first step of installing a new water heater is to detach the existing one. Residential and commercial property owners who are wanting to update their water heaters typically go with tank water heaters. Whether you are building a new home or you are looking to install a more efficient water heater for your residential or commercial project, choosing the right system is important.</p>
