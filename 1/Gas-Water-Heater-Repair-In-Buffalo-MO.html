Not only are they highly efficient, but they can also save you money by heating water only on-demand. Used for decades in Europe where living space is at a premium, tankless water heaters are a safe and reliable way to use less energy. What can go wrong: A single tankless heater may not have sufficient capacity to supply hot water to multiple locations at the same time.</p>

When you find yourself with a hot water tank leaking water, it could lead to significant water damage to your home and belongings.</p>
<p>Whole-home tankless gas water heaters have specific flow rates that are relative to the necessary temperature rise. With new water heater efficiency standards, we now have the opportunity to have it all. Although gas and electric water heaters can lose some efficiency because water is constantly being heated in the tank, current efficiency standards are much improved over the past. Most water heaters are gas, so even the smallest of mistakes made during installation can cause added expenses, property damage, injury, or even death.</p>

The main difference between electric and gas water heaters is the heat source. Once power and water supply issues are addressed, a tankless water heater is fairly straightforward to install and is certainly much easier to maneuver into place.</p>
