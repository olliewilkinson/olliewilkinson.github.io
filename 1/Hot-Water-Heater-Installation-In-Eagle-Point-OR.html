<h2>Water Heater Services Eagle Point Oregon</h2>
<p>When it comes to do it yourself projects around the house, you can save a bundle of money over having someone else do the work for you. Tankless water heaters provide hot water right when you need it. By heating cold water directly, you don't have to wait for hot water to fill the tank. Tankless water heaters are rated to produce specific levels of heat. When you encounter a problem with your water heater, you aren't able to do any of these things, and that's a major disruption to your life. Payback time was longer for a tankless unit that replaced an existing storage tank but more reasonable with new construction.</p>
<p>We've been working in and around the Laguna Hills and Mission Viejo area for over 20 years, and in that time have refined our services to become the best. If however, the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is lower than the setting of the lower thermostat, the lower thermostat switches "on" and sends voltage to the lower heating element (a thermostat that has switched power to a heating element or cooling compressor is said to be "calling") and heats the water.</p>
<p>A local plumbing company such as Atlas Home Services eliminates the guesswork—and the hassle—around replacing your old water heater. By some estimates, a tankless hot water heater uses 22% less energy than its traditional counterpart.

Savings: Unlike traditional water heaters, tankless units only heat water as it is needed, which results in extra energy savings per month. Although gas tankless water heaters are clearly more efficient than their storage tank cousins, their efficiency normally tops out at 80-85%.</p>
<p>While scale can shorten the life of the heating element, you don't need to invest in fancy features to get a water heater that lasts. Tankless heaters can be installed underneath sinks or in small closets as well as in traditional hot water tank enclosures. As a result, their expected equipment life is possibly longer - more than 20 years, compared with 10 - 15 years for traditional heaters.
