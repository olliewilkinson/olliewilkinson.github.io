Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box). Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the type of traditional hot water tank you had, you may be able to install it in the same area.

You don't have to worry about a water heater that is constantly heating up water, because the tankless water heater will only heat up the water that you need since it provides on-demand hot water.

<p>To minimize the cost of hot water, reduce the temperature of your hot water heater from the standard 140 degrees F to 120 degrees F. This should be an adequate supply for your family's hot water needs and the cost will be significantly lower than if you heated it continuously to the higher temperature. They constantly heat water so hot water is regularly prepared. If a tank still makes noise once sediment has been flushed, there is probably a more serious problem with the water heater overall.</p>
<p>If the pressure is much lower now, you either need to limit your hot water demand or ask a plumber about upgrading your tankless water heater.

This is not covered in the video, but you should always check that the water heater is not receiving any electricity after shutting it off at the circuit breaker.</p>
<p>Safety: Tank-style water heaters can build up pressure and become dangerous. Use heating coils instead of natural gas to provide hot water for home.

<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
