<h2>Water Heater Services Trinidad Colorado</h2>

Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion.

There are some less common causes that can make your electric water heater not as effective or efficient as it used to be.
