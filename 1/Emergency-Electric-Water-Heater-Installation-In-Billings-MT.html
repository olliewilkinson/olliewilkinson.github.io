<h2>Water Heater Services Billings Montana</h2>
<p>If you are thinking of replacing your gas tank-style unit with a tankless model, you should consider an outdoor installation. An electric water heater has an upper and a lower heating element. Storage tank: Storage tank water heaters typically have a capacity of 30 to 60 gallons, but the most common size is 50 gallons. The disadvantage with this tankless gas heater is that it takes a few seconds before hot water starts flowing. You don't know how old the water heater is or when it was last serviced. If all of these advantages sound good to you, call us today at 423-718-7342 for tankless water heater installation services.</p>
<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>
<p>A local plumbing company such as Atlas Home Services eliminates the guesswork—and the hassle—around replacing your old water heater. By some estimates, a tankless hot water heater uses 22% less energy than its traditional counterpart. Whether you are in of water heater repairs or you're interested in upgrading to a newer, more efficient tankless model, our expert plumbing technicians can help. Check the Energy Factor (EF) to see how efficient the unit is. A higher EF rating indicates better efficiency.</p>
<h3>Affordable Tankless Water Heater Repair Billings</h3>
<p>Admittedly, your old water heater is one of the biggest contributors to that high energy bill, and replacing it could mean considerable savings. Tankless water heaters have become increasingly popular due to their efficiency and compact size. Several smaller units cannot produce enough hot water for simultaneous purposes in large families. As many homeowners look for ways to lower their energy costs, one area of improvement is water heating.</p>
<p>It'll take about 20 to 30 minutes to completely drain a 40 gallon water heater. Keep in mind that the tank size you need should be based on the maximum amount of hot water you will need during busy times, not on the storage room available for it. In some cases, you may have to switch to an outdoor model is the size you need can't be accommodated in the space available inside your home. There are several different factors worth considering before purchasing a new water heater.</p>
<p>Instead, they have a heating system that allows for on-demand hot water. The biggest trend currently is tankless water heaters. If you choose to proceed with a new water heater installation, we offer financing options to ease the upfront cost burden. A tankless hot water heater is a heating element installed near the point of use. Some may include a specific exclusion to water damage from water heaters or burst pipes — so it's useful to learn when your policy is applicable.</p>
<p>Replacing your current water heater with a newer model can help reduce water heating bills by about 7 percent. Proper installation can impact the life expectancy of your Vancouver hot water heater, so we always recommend that our customers invest in professional installation services. Maybe you're considering a tankless water heater for great energy savings and an endless supply of hot water. It doesn't waste energy heating up water while you are at work or on holidays.</p>
<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Billings MT</h3>
<p>This is especially true for those units that have gone without proper maintenance or repairs when needed. That's 2X the life of a traditional hot water heater. When long-term costs matter, the electric tankless water heater is the most cost-effective option, but is not the most efficient fuel source. Gas or electric demand units average about the same cost to purchase. Each type of water heater has their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>If you can't confidently say you know how to install a water heater you really need to use caution. As opposed to waiting for a storage tank to fill with enough hot water for use, tankless water heaters provide a constant supply of it. If you're looking for an energy-efficient option to supply your home with hot water, tankless water heaters are worth serious consideration. However, tankless water heaters are becoming standard in new developments, so if you live in a newer home or a home that has recently been remodeled, you may have a tankless system supplying hot water to your home.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Billings Montana 59102</h3>
<p>Our plumbers will carefully look over your water heater and make the necessary repairs fast. Call Polestar Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning at (913) 432-3342 for expert Merriam water heater services. This is much different from a conventional water heater, which heats a large tank of water all the time so that it's still hot when you need it. They also are very well insulated to conserve the heat that the tank maintains while holding heated water.</p>
<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
<p>Instead, the water is heated when it passes through the system, which may be fuelled by gas or electricity. Typical home water heaters are the large storage types that take up a significant amount of room in the garage or basement. After a while fixing a leak-prone water heater can become costly. Our plumbers know that this can be stressful, but we are here to offer quick and effective water heater replacement service for your home or business.</p>
<p>While new storage water heaters are more efficient, they have had to grow in size. But if you have a large family, you'll likely need the faster heating capability of a gas unit. Call water heaters repair services. We see this a lot on traditional electric water heaters, which use a pair of electric heating elements to heat the tank. After your water heater tank has filled with water, turn on the circuit breaker at the main power box.</p>
<p>From standard tank water heaters to tankless to solar water heaters, we have an option that will match your needs and save energy. Age: As a rule, if your water heater is more than ten years old, it's time to invest in a new water heater. As soon you turn off the water flow, the heater turns off. The traditional water heater keeps water hot 24 hours a day even you are at work or sleeping. Most tank-style water heaters last about eight to 12 years.</p>
