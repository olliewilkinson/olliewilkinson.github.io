Tankless water heaters do not store water but heat the water you use directly as you need it. These tanks operate on either gas or electricity and are activated only when hot water is required.

<p>When your water heater breaks down, you want to call someone you can trust. Accordingly, the best place to install a tankless system is directly next to the water fixture. For a simple install with no need to run additional gas lines to a new hookup, an install will take an average of around 3-4 hours for a total installation cost of $150-$600. Over time, even well-maintained water heaters will begin to lose efficiency and develop more problems associated with wear and tear.</p>
<p>If so, a tankless water heater may be a good option for your home and your family. A tankless system on the other hand doesn't store water, but rather heats it only when you need it.

<p>Lower temperatures have also been proven to make your tankless gas water heater last longer because less minerals and corrosion will build up.

<p>Enjoy reliable water heater servicing and protection with Miracle Plumbing Inc. We have many years of experience working on all types of hot water heaters. Besides sizing the unit appropriately, I'll want to know what the manufacturer's minimum flow rate is, what type of water quality is required by the manufacturer, and exactly what the warranty covers. With a tank heater, water sits for long periods of time, and this can corrode heating elements, the inside of the tank, and the bottom often fills with sediment.</p>
<p>When you need a new tankless water heater installed, your first task should be to select a reliable plumbing company who will provide you with free written price quotes, a history of reliability and integrity, a connection to your community, and a dedication to customer service and satisfaction.
