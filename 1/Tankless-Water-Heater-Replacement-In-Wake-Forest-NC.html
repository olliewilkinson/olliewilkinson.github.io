A tankless water heater installation really isn't all that complicated and there aren't too many parts that have to be purchased. Gas is more energy efficient and cheaper to run, but electric will not make a drastic difference. Tankless Water Heaters have become a really hot commodity in the last couple of years (I know, that was a really bad pun).</p>

<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions. With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason. While tankless hot water heaters are generally more efficient than conventional water heaters, we can help you maintain your conventional water heater, or install a new conventional water heater, in a manner that will allow your conventional water heater to run just as efficiently as many tankless hot water heaters.</p>
