<h2>Water Heater Services Wood River Illinois</h2>
<p>Doctor Fix it is now offering a water heater that includes a lifetime warranty. However, for households that use large amounts of hot water, the tankless will never run out of hot water. If you would like a new water heater for your home or business, call us today to make an appointment for water heater installation in Hendersonville, Mills River and Asheville, NC. We can help you find the best water heater brand and then install it quickly and efficiently. But if a heater's Btu output can't keep up with demand, it will cut back the flow, or, worse case, deliver lukewarm water.</p>
<p>Fortunately, since tankless heaters do not have a tank, there is absolutely zero risk of an explosion ever occurring. Sometimes the hot water tank in the system is the only one used to provide the home with hot water—and many modern solar water tanks come with a built-in electric element for auxiliary heating when the sun isn't shining enough. In commercial settings, manifold systems link multiple tankless units together to dramatically increase their heating capacity while decreasing the individual load.</p>
<p>Your Atlas plumbing expert will explain your tankless water heater options. If you do choose water heater replacement, we'll help you choose the best new water heater for your home. These heaters are ultra-efficient and offer an energy and money savings compared to the traditional water heater.

<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Wood River</h3>
<p>The difference between the two is how the water is heated - either through natural gas or electrical resistance coils. 1st Home & Commercial Services can upgrade your water system to the latest energy-efficient technology. Water heaters are one of the most important components of your plumbing system. No energy is wasted keeping water hot that may not be needed for several hours. In general, costs associated with heating water will be higher when using propane because the fuel is more expensive than natural gas.</p>
<p>Water underneath the water heater is almost always a sure sign that your water heater needs replacing. Raise the gas burner or the lower heating element on an electric water heater at least eighteen inches above the floor if the equipment is in the garage. In large homes however, you might need more than one for a proper supply of hot water. Generally residential water heaters have a life expectancy of 8-12 years.</p>
<p>Electric tankless units can potentially help you save on home energy use and provide continuous hot water on demand. Leaks - If you're finding water around the base of your hot water tank, then your water heater has most likely already corroded beyond the ability for a repair. It's Making Noise - As your water heats, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. Some of them have the anode installed in a separate opening on top of the tank and some use a combination anode rod that is installed in the hot water outlet of the tank.</p>
<p>You'll need to find out how to dispose of your old water heater and check out the local codes for disposal. In this example, the whole-home tankless gas water heater is roughly $1000 more than the high-efficiency gas storage water heater over a 15 year time period. If you install a tankless hot water heater that is too small, your hot water flow can decrease when multiple plumbing fixtures are turned on simultaneously.</p>

When it's time to take a shower, run the dishwasher, or throw a load of clothes into the washing machine, a tankless water heater will quickly heat up the water you need. This is because they only heat water when there is a demand for it, rather than keeping a large amount of water heated at all times. Tanks with larger capacity or energy-efficiency upgrades cost more.</p>

<p>The most popular brands of water heaters are reliable, affordable, have good value and are always available. While tankless water heaters run more efficiently than storage tank water heaters, replacing a tank water heater with a tankless can be expensive, and the payback time can be longer than the warranty.
