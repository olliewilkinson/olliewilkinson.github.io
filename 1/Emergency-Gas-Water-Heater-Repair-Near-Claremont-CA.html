<p>The difference between the two is how the water is heated - either through natural gas or electrical resistance coils. 1st Home & Commercial Services can upgrade your water system to the latest energy-efficient technology. Water heaters are one of the most important components of your plumbing system. No energy is wasted keeping water hot that may not be needed for several hours. In general, costs associated with heating water will be higher when using propane because the fuel is more expensive than natural gas.</p>
<p>If the valve didn't work, then the water heater needs to be replaced. Step 3. Turn off the water to the water heater or if the valve is not working turn off the water to the house.

<p>Not every house or business is going to use the same energy source to run their appliances, which is why it's so great that tankless water heaters can either be electric or gas. However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>
