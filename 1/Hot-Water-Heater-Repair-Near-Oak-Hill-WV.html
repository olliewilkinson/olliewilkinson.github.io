However, a tankless water heater can last 20 to 30 years. If you notice your water just isn't getting as hot as it's supposed to, it may be time for a water heater replacement. One of the most common reasons for water heater repair is the lack of heated water.</p>
<p>Water heaters are dangerous and can cause a variety of hazardous conditions both for the person attempting to tinker with the heater and for the residents of the entire household. Indirect water heaters cost $800 to $1,500 on average. If the buildup is left unattended and the tank has rusted, it is time for a new water heater altogether.

A tankless water heater will save you money since it provides instant heating when hot water is needed rather than constantly heating and reheating the same water until it is used. The harder the water, the more problems homeowners will encounter in terms of scale buildup in their pipes, regular and tankless water heaters, and dishwashers.</p>

<p>You can even install a tankless unit on your outside wall. Call Polestar Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning at (913) 432-3342 to schedule an appointment. The key feature is that the heater does not turn on until it senses that a hot water tap is being opened. They only heat the water as it's needed, unlike storage tank water heaters that require continuous maintenance of the temperature of the water in the tank.</p>
<p>Determining whether you should repair your water heater or purchase a new one depends solely on what is wrong with it in the first place. They know from experience which models of heaters tend to hold up the best to the hard water. Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity. Tankless systems heat water by activating a set of coils that become hot when the unit is turned on. As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>
<p>Heaters with water tank normally consume lots of extra energy to keep the stored water warm, which in turn, cost higher for the operation. Your old water heater was probably D rated, whereas these new units are A rated and better for the environment. This is the kind of energy-saving customization that is impossible with tank-style water heaters. That may be enough to supply a whole house in areas with warm groundwater, but in colder climes they're better suited to point-of-use service, where the demand for hot water doesn't get too high.</p>

Install your black iron gas piping with a shut-off valve and a dirt leg at the water heater.
