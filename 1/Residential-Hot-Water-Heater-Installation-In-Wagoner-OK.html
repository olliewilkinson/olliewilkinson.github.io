<h3>Local Tankless Water Heater Repair Wagoner</h3>
<p>Takes up minimal space- Unlike tank water heaters which take up a large amount of space, tankless water heaters are very small. Choose the efficient source of hot water that never runs out, a Navien tankless water heater brought to you by the Watertown tankless water heater pros, Pann Home Services, 866.562.0195. Condensing gas heaters can extract up to 96 percent of a fuel's heat—a 17 percent improvement over first-generation tankless units—thanks to a second heat exchanger that captures much of the exhaust heat before it goes out the vent.</p>
<p>If the temperature sensor (9) detects that the water exceeds or falls short of the desired setting, the panel will adjust the gas valve, the mixing valve, and the flow-regulating water valve (10) accordingly. Water heater problems are a good example of when this choice is important. Along with our furnaces and boilers, our water heaters are also available in various styles, efficiency levels, and brands - one of which includes the Navien brand.</p>

If there's a problem with the heater's thermocouple, the problem is critical because it's actually a safety instrument that detects when the pilot light is on. If the pilot isn't lit the gas valve won't turn the gas on. When a hot water tap is turned on, water enters the tankless water heater.</p>

Another major reason for people electing a tankless system is avoidance of the "shower frigid dance." If you have ever been halfway through a shower and had the hot water give out, you know what I mean. Considering the many advantages over traditional tank-type units, it isn't hard to see why homeowners love tankless systems.</p>
