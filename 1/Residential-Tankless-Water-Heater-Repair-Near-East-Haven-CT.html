<h2>Water Heater Services East Haven Connecticut</h2>
<p>It's hard to believe it, but over 19,000 water heaters are replaced every day. Most conventional natural-draft water heaters vent exhaust completely different than any tankless water heater, and though they are a fuel burning appliance, they do need power to operate. Many thermostats have a reset button which can sometimes be pushed to reset the circuit and get the water heater working again. Once we've discussed your viable options and you've made a selection, our technicians can carefully remove your old water heater and safely install your new one.</p>
<p>If the water heater is located in an attic, water damage can result in every ceiling and floor beneath the water heater. Your water requirements will also have to be considered when choosing a tankless water heater. Our GoHot tankless heater is only the size of a briefcase. Since we are talking about electric tankless, the only thing I will say about gas models is that they almost always have better performance than electric models.</p>
<p>When a hot water tap is turned on, water from your pipes enters the water heater and passes through the heat exchanger. It provides you with enough hot water to wash your dishes and your clothes, to bathe and shower, and to heat the water for cleaning cabinets, mopping floors, washing your hair, and more. For the home that has an average consumption of hot water a 40 gallon tank is normally sufficient. Emergency Water and Gas Shut Off Valve - Also known as "WAGS".</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement East Haven</h3>
<p>This may be an old resistive type heater and should be replaced by more modern heaters that can be up to 5 times more efficient at heating water. Savings: Unlike traditional water heaters, tankless units only heat water as it is needed, which results in extra energy savings per month. Although gas tankless water heaters are clearly more efficient than their storage tank cousins, their efficiency normally tops out at 80-85%.</p>
<p>When you are ready for your shower you push a button and the pump sends the heated water from your water heater to your fixture more quickly than if you run the shower at full blast, and the pump shuts off when the hot water reaches it. Thus you save time, water, energy, and money. Tank heaters must always keep water warm after heating it. This process means that they continuously cycle on and off to keep water warm.</p>

All hot water system installation must be done by a licensed plumber in accordance with hot water system installation regulations.</p>
<p>It's just a matter of time before your water heater will need to be replaced and it is always better to schedule it out than deal with an untimely breakdown. Replacing your hot water tank can be a costly venture. In comparison, the average life expectancy of an electric tank water heater is about 12 or 13 years. If you have a bulky storage model that seems to be guzzling electricity or gas then you should replace it with the latest tankless direct vent gas version as this can enable you to save around 10% to 30% in your energy bills.</p>

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
