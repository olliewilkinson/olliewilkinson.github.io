<h2>Water Heater Services Rutherfordton North Carolina</h2>
<p>If you have been considering buying a new water heater, you might have been told that you need a 50 gallon water heater if you have a family with 3 or 4 members in your household. Traditional water heaters can deliver as much hot water as the pipes will allow all at once. Broken pilot light: If you have a gas water heater, a lack of hot water may signal that its pilot light has gone out. Call the tankless water heater plumbers from Benjamin Franklin Plumbing today at (800) 259-7705 for help. The presence of puddles of water around the heater or water seeping down the sides of the heater are usually signs that the water heater tank may be fractured.</p>
<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call. A tank-style water heater expends energy around the clock to maintain the temperature of a 40 to 50-gallon water supply so that hot water is ready when it's needed. Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>
<p>Strategically planning the location of your tankless water heater maximizes its flow and water temperatures. When you turn on the faucet, warm water is pumped from the top of the tank to where you need it and cold water is pumped into the bottom of the tank to be heated until its ready for use. Even though tankless water heaters can deliver an unlimited amount of hot water, there's a limit to how much water can be delivered at once.</p>

<p>If your water has frozen inside your water heater contact the manufacturer. If you suddenly wake up to find no hot water in the house, give us a call for a prompt response and emergency service, when needed.

If hot water is in particularly high demand in your household, you may need to install multiple tankless water heaters or opt for a traditional tank model.

<p>As mentioned earlier, a tank heater only lasts about 10-12 years before having to be replaced, mostly because of corrosion inside the tank. Both these models are tankless and use natural gas, although you can also find models that use propane gas. Gas tankless water heaters are more expensive to install. Unlike the traditional tank water heater which is selected based on the capacity of the tank inside it, a tankless water heater will be chosen on its ability to service the demand during peak usage times throughout the day.</p>

Our trained and certified plumbers will provide you with an honest, upfront price on the cost to install a tankless water heater ($29 or FREE if you choose us to install your water heater). For safety reasons, the water heater should not be on air conditioning lines or under pipes that can drip.</p>
<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Rutherfordton NC</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters remove the need for a bulky water tank. Paloma tankless has a variety of heater which you could chose form either it is for your house, or for commercial use. Setting the top thermostat higher will not cause the top element to turn on if the water temperature in the top of the tank is already higher than the highest setting of the thermostat. This strategy saves water as well as energy, thereby making this option one of the most efficient, as well as saving on space.</p>
<p>Age: If your unit is older, and especially if it requires repairs or replacement parts to keep it functioning, it can be more cost-effective to install a new unit. Frequent breakdowns are a good indicator that it may be time for a full water heater replacement. Tank-style heaters don't produce hot water instantly either but since they have a supply ready to go and don't need to kick on, it reaches the outlet more quickly.</p>
<p>The drain valve is located at the bottom of the water heater. And there are no large electrical power demands needed as with the electric heater. Not enough hot water may also mean that your water heater is on its last leg and needs to be replaced. With a tankless water heater you can eliminate this heat loss because the water is only heated when you need it. This can end up saving money on your monthly energy bill and conserve energy.</p>

The gas hot water replacement cost would be between $1000 and $2500, in a different location. The smaller unit reduces your risk of getting scalded, since huge amounts of hot water aren't stored in a tank, but rather are processed as needed.</p>
<p>Relive the old days by learning how you can replace your own water heater for about $400 and a few hours of work. Our experts at Anthony Plumbing, the premier Plumber in Kansas City recommend replacing the heater before it starts displaying performance issues to save on heating costs. There will need to be two or three people to perform this stage, due to the size of the water heater and the height at which it will be mounted.</p>
<p>Use channel-type pliers or a pipe wrench to loosen and disconnect the lines from the water heater. Over time, water heaters often suffer from sediment build-up that can damage the tank. For example, a sudden loss of hot water may mean that the pilot has gone out. Be sure to connect the cold water pipe to the cold water inlet on the water heater. Cold water enters the tank and is heated by an electric element or gas burner.</p>
