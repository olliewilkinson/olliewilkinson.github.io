<p>When it comes to do it yourself projects around the house, you can save a bundle of money over having someone else do the work for you. Tankless water heaters provide hot water right when you need it. By heating cold water directly, you don't have to wait for hot water to fill the tank.

However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock.
