<h2>Water Heater Services Monticello Kentucky</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Regardless of how well you maintain and care for your water heater, the average life span of most water heaters is from 8 to 12 years. If you live in the following neighborhoods of Agoura Hill, Downtown, Forest Cove, South end, Malibu Junction, East Agoura, and Old Agoura, then you need to find plumbing services to help you repair your heater.

<p>Energy Savings: Because these units only heat water when it's needed, you can save big on energy costs. Water heaters are essentially steel tanks with vitreous glass bonded to the inside to protect the steel from rust. Retrofitting a home with a tankless unit can be a complicated process as compared to traditional storage tank and may cost as high as $3,000. Gas water heater: Turn off the gas supply at the shutoff valve on the gas pipe nearest the water heater.</p>
<p>While scale can shorten the life of the heating element, you don't need to invest in fancy features to get a water heater that lasts. Tankless heaters can be installed underneath sinks or in small closets as well as in traditional hot water tank enclosures. As a result, their expected equipment life is possibly longer - more than 20 years, compared with 10 - 15 years for traditional heaters. We have a range of gas and electric tank water heaters offered in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>
<p>Before you make the switch, make sure to read plenty of reviews of tankless water heaters Get quotes from several professionals to determine who has the best prices, and don't forget to check online references and reviews for each one.
