<h2>Water Heater Services Wellston Ohio</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>The tankless hot water heater will heat the water as it goes through the heat exchanger, which is activated by the incoming water as it flows through. Gas water heaters require gas lines that provide fuel to the ignition system and burner. If you are not experienced in maintaining a water heater, it is best to bring in a plumber to maintain it annually. Your perfect water heater will differ depending on your hot water expectations, your budget, and the layout of your home.</p>
