<h2>Water Heater Services Collegeville Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>If you have been considering buying a new water heater, you might have been told that you need a 50 gallon water heater if you have a family with 3 or 4 members in your household. Traditional water heaters can deliver as much hot water as the pipes will allow all at once. Broken pilot light: If you have a gas water heater, a lack of hot water may signal that its pilot light has gone out. Call the tankless water heater plumbers from Benjamin Franklin Plumbing today at (800) 259-7705 for help. The presence of puddles of water around the heater or water seeping down the sides of the heater are usually signs that the water heater tank may be fractured.</p>
<p>For a standard 40 gallon water heater you now only have about 34 gallons. The short delay between when the water starts to flow and when the heater kicks on causes a short burst of cold water before turning hot. Because methods for repairing the problem may depend on whether your water heater is gas or electric, these are discussed separately below. Electric Water Heater: For homes that are powered mainly by electricity, an electric water heater is likely the best option.</p>
<p>If your heater is in an inconvenient spot or a tight space, a tankless system might be able to help you out. It takes 60-70 minutes to heat a 100-gallon tank (recovery rate) with gas. Step 2. Turn off the gas going to the water heater at the valve that connects to the front of the water heater.

<p>Electric tank-type heaters utilize electrical-resistance heating elements located within the hot water storage tank to heat up the water within the tank.

<p>Conventional tank water heaters: These water heaters are typically powered by natural gas or electricity. A unit can usually be installed in a day. We perform routine flushes as well as repairs to electric and gas tankless heaters. If you decide on a tankless water heater in Auburn, we'll help you get one that will serve you well and last for a long, long time.

<p>Their components are an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water until it's needed. Depending on the position of your water hookups, you may not be able to use the oversized water heater at all. Traditional water heaters come with up to a six-year warranty. These gases are blown through a coil in the base of the unit, where incoming cold water can absorb most of the heat.</p>

Without a working water heater, you'll be stuck with cold showers, dishes you can't properly sanitize, and a washing machine that won't clean your clothes. Descale the heater and flush it according to the maintenance steps.</p>

The amount you pay for service goes towards your replacement. In addition, we are trained to repair and install commercial tankless water heater and commercial water heater systems. Luckily, hot water heaters are fairly simple and don't have a lot of moving parts.</p>
<p>From time to time, repairs are required to meet some common problems like lukewarm water, a small flow, or a leak. With tankless water heaters, there's no storage hot water tank to leak or break, thus reducing the risk of flooding. Before making repairs or purchasing a new water heater, check the nameplate on the side of your current unit. Heating your water can use a lot of energy. If steam or excessively hot water shoots out of faucets, or you hear boiling sounds inside the water heater, the appliance may not be shutting off at its set temperature.</p>
