<p>It's hard to believe it, but over 19,000 water heaters are replaced every day.

You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>

The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>

<p>Initial Cost - Tank heaters are cheaper to purchase and typically less expensive to install. However, f you use more hot water daily (around 86 gallons or more), then you may only get to enjoy an additional 8-10% energy efficiency. With sediment piling up on the bottom of your tank, your water heater is trying to heat water through the mound of dirt, leading to a longer wait time for your water to heat. If your water heater malfunctions, the first step is to turn off both the power and water supply to the water heater to prevent further damage.</p>
<p>Most tankless water heaters have a life expectancy of more than 20 years. Even with a tankless a.k.a. instantaneous water heater, you won't have instant hot water whenever you open the kitchen faucet or another outlet. The average energy savings and additional lifespan make tankless heaters a viable option for many homes. Generally as your heater ages sediment build-up will occur, decreasing the amount of hot water that the heater can produce.</p>
<p>In your specific case, this may require a larger gas line or a much larger electric supply than what is currently running to your water heater location. Only gas can produce enough hot water for a large home. Contact us anytime you think your water heater needs repair service.
