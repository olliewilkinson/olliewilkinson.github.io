If your electric hot water heater is slow to heat, runs out of hot water faster than it used to, or doesn't deliver any hot water at all, there's a 90 percent chance that simply replacing one or both of the heating elements will solve the problem.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement Monongahela</h3>
<p>If your family has grown larger or smaller, this is a good time to consider upsizing or downsizing your water heater. A traditional water heater stores hot water in a large tank. You'll need to have the water heater cleaned out, but we also strongly recommend installing a water softener to eliminate the problem at the source. With tankless electric water heaters, there is a direct relationship between the flow rate of a fixture (demand), the power supplied to the tankless electric water heater, and the output temperature of the hot water.</p>
<p>Typically, tankless water heaters furnish heated up water at a speed around 2 - 5 gallons every minute. With routine maintenance, you can avoid having to repair your water heater, and it will last much longer. When it comes time to replace yours, chances are, you'll pick the same type of unit - either gas or electric. It is estimated that 5-10 million hot water tanks go to the landfill each year.

No storage or holding tank means that tankless water heaters have a life span twice as long as traditional systems because the risk of rust and corrosion is significantly lower.</p>
<p>You'll need to find out how to dispose of your old water heater and check out the local codes for disposal. In this example, the whole-home tankless gas water heater is roughly $1000 more than the high-efficiency gas storage water heater over a 15 year time period. If you install a tankless hot water heater that is too small, your hot water flow can decrease when multiple plumbing fixtures are turned on simultaneously.</p>

Simply go to your water heater, check the temperature dial, and make sure it is set in between 115 to 120 degrees F (or 46 degrees to 49 degrees C). Lowering the setting will prevent the tank from overheating, which reduces energy bills drastically.</p>
