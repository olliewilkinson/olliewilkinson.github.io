<h2>Water Heater Services Bridgeport Connecticut</h2>
<p>If you have been considering buying a new water heater, you might have been told that you need a 50 gallon water heater if you have a family with 3 or 4 members in your household. Traditional water heaters can deliver as much hot water as the pipes will allow all at once. Broken pilot light: If you have a gas water heater, a lack of hot water may signal that its pilot light has gone out. Call the tankless water heater plumbers from Benjamin Franklin Plumbing today at (800) 259-7705 for help. The presence of puddles of water around the heater or water seeping down the sides of the heater are usually signs that the water heater tank may be fractured.</p>
<p>Propane is available as both traditional tank water heaters starting at $560, and tankless products beginning around $600, other options include a single, wall-mounted, tankless, 1.5 GPM shower unit with a battery powered igniter and a showerhead for approximately $110. A tankless water heater may be the right option for you. Currently, there is too little data to accurately estimate life expectancy for tankless water heaters, but preliminary data shows that tankless water heaters could last up to 20 years.</p>
<p>The small device can be installed underneath a sink on the wall where hot and cold water supply lines are accessible. Another one of the advantages that comes along with using a tankless water heater is that it lasts a lot longer than your standard water heater. It is best to have a professional take care of these type of issues as there are electrical and water hazards involved in making these repairs. Having tankless heater in your house produces endless supply of hot water.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Replacement Bridgeport</h3>
<p>If your family has grown larger or smaller, this is a good time to consider upsizing or downsizing your water heater. A traditional water heater stores hot water in a large tank. You'll need to have the water heater cleaned out, but we also strongly recommend installing a water softener to eliminate the problem at the source. With tankless electric water heaters, there is a direct relationship between the flow rate of a fixture (demand), the power supplied to the tankless electric water heater, and the output temperature of the hot water.</p>
<p>There are times when constant water heater repair in Thousand Oaks isn't in your best interest. The tankless water heater will give the household a luxury of hot water on demand at the press of a button. We'll also make sure that you have a system where a tankless water heater installation can happen or that you understand the modifications that need to be made before we can complete that. The first reason is that they are looking for a water heater that is able to offer them better energy efficiency.</p>

Our experienced, courteous plumbers will answer your emergency call, perform regular maintenance and tune-ups, install a new tankless water heater or hot water tank, or replace your unit when it's time.</p>
<p>Natural gas units are the least expensive choice and are powered from a city utility supply which costs an average of $200 per year. Tankless gas water heaters have wider applications, as they supply hot water at higher flow rates. And keep in mind that because of recent federal energy regulations, a replacement storage tank may take up more space than your old one, even if it's the same capacity, because newer ones are required to have more insulation.</p>
<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Bridgeport CT</h3>
<p>Doctor Water Heater also provides tankless water heater installation and maintenance. In many cases, existing piping must be extended or relocated, and for a gas unit, a safe vent must be installed to prevent carbon monoxide from accumulating inside the home. The units provide as much as 7 gallons of hot water per minute and will never run out of hot water. Cycling losses - the loss of heat as the water circulates through a water heater tank, or inlet and outlet pipes.</p>

Our experienced technicians are equipped and trained for electric water heater repair. When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution. Traditional water heaters work by heating and storing a set amount of water in a tank. Turning on hot water throughout the home activates the heater, even if the pilot light is not on, so you are able to check the pipes for leaks much more easily.</p>
<p>Most homeowners have conventional water heaters that come with a tank where hot water is stored. Replacement of the anode rod: To prevent water from corroding the inside of the tank, a water heater includes a sacrificial” anode rod—a long piece of metal that the water eats away at instead of the tank walls. Another problem is that once this set amount of water runs out you have to wait until the tank reheats more water.</p>
<p>Natural-gas water heaters typically use less energy and cost less to run (by about half) than electric water heaters, although you should note that gas models cost more at the time of purchase. We also provide emergency plumbing services 24 hours a day 7 days a week. When properly maintained, tankless water heaters often have a lifespan of at least 20 years (approximately twice that of conventional storage tanks).</p>
