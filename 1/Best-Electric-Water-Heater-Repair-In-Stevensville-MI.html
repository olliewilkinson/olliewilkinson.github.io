Tankless water heaters are rated to produce specific levels of heat. When you encounter a problem with your water heater, you aren't able to do any of these things, and that's a major disruption to your life. Payback time was longer for a tankless unit that replaced an existing storage tank but more reasonable with new construction.</p>
