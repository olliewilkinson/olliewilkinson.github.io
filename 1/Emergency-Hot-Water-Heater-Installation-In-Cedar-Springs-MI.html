<h2>Water Heater Services Cedar Springs Michigan</h2>
<p>One of the most common investments a homeowner finds themselves required to make in a home is a new water heater. Many people are now going to tankless or on-demand hot water heaters simply because they are more energy efficient and use water only as it is needed. Anthony PHC Kansas City helps you upgrade to an instant water heater. In the colder months, it might not be an issue with your water heater. Before you start you need to make sure you have sufficient space for the tankless water heater you will be installing. We can even install hot water tanks in homes that are undergoing renovations because hot water plays an important role in our day-to-day activities.</p>
<p>Fortunately, since tankless heaters do not have a tank, there is absolutely zero risk of an explosion ever occurring. Sometimes the hot water tank in the system is the only one used to provide the home with hot water—and many modern solar water tanks come with a built-in electric element for auxiliary heating when the sun isn't shining enough. In commercial settings, manifold systems link multiple tankless units together to dramatically increase their heating capacity while decreasing the individual load.</p>
<p>Tankless usually cost between three and five times as much as a normal water heater for the initial purchase. The problem may be caused by the water heater's main breaker. Endless hot water, additional storage space and lower energy bills are just a few reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters. Tankless water heaters also take up much less space and can be installed virtually anywhere in your home.</p>

<p>Petersen Plumbing does not recommend tankless water heaters in locations with hard well water, or where galvanized steel pipe is present either in the building, or in the water service to the building. Capacity: The size of on-demand water heaters should be based on the number of occupants in the home and their peak hour water demand, rather than the size of the house. Units that undergo routine checks and upgrades last longer and undergo less frequent and costly repairs.</p>
<p>In the one tank system, the solar storage and the backup heater are all part of the same unit, and in the two-tank system, the solar component in the system heats the water before it is fed through to the water heater. That's right, some people actually see their gas bills go up because more hot water is being used since there's more available now.
