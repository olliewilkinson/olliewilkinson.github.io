<h2>Water Heater Services Taos New Mexico</h2>
<p>All households require hot water, so your water heater is one of your most essential home appliances. As the name suggests, this type of water heater does not have a storage tank. Regularly scheduled maintenance can help extend the life of the water heater and it includes performing a water heater flush, checking the valves and connections for leaks and more. If you are not looking to apply more then one outlet then you would be well served by the standard and far less expensive model of the tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Age- Most water heaters last roughly 10 - 15 years. A plumbing inspector will come to your place and look at the installation to make sure that the work was done properly. Rust: Anytime there's rust on the outside of your tank, around fittings, or in the water itself, you're water heater may be on its last legs. Solar power water heater systems use the sun's energy to generate warm water for your home. The compact designs of this kind of heater leaves space for a water softener or additional storage such as "use it as you need it".</p>

Energy Efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water, using about 35% less energy than a tank water heater. While it's true that the T&P Valve is likely to leak after testing it, the danger involved if it failed makes the risk of a leak worth it. If you want to see what could potentially happen due to a failed T&P, just Google "water heater blast" and check out the video at the website of that name.</p>
<p>When you lose power, there is a reserve of hot water for a short time period. You have no hot water: If you don't have hot water in your home, your water heater clearly isn't working.

<p>You can also use a tankless hot water system which effectively only heats the water that you need when you need it.

When this happens, the pressure inside your water heater will build up and an explosion will occur.
