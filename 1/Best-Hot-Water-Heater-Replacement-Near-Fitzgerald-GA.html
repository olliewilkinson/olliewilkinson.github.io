This isn't just a problem with showers, depending on the size of your water heater, you can run into issues by having a shower and the dishwasher running at the same time.</p>
<p>When the hot water tap is activated, cold water travels through a pipe into the tankless unit, where either a gas or electric element delivers heat.

For example, if a gas powered tankless water heater is not properly connected to its gas supply line, a gas leak could develop.</p>
