<p>Tankless water heaters have been growing in popularity lately, especially with the new water heater energy efficiency regulations.

<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>
<p>If electric you will probably need 220 volt service run to the location where the unit will be installed, which can also be some what expensive. If you have a gas water heater and you smell gas inside the premises, it is an emergency situation, you need to call water heaters repair services urgently. That means you will always get 120° water from your hot faucet when you turn it on, until the tank begins to replenish the tank from the cold water source.</p>

Old water heaters aren't just inefficient, they are inconvenient. Fixed the tank less water heater.
