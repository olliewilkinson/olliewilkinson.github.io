<h2>Water Heater Services Palo Alto California</h2>
<p>The water heater is an immensely important fixture in your house. You can try raising the temperature on the water heater, as discussed directly above. Once the water in the top part of the tank has reached the temperature value determined by the top thermostat setting, the top thermostat (is considered "satisfied") switches power from the top element to the lower thermostat. We can help guide you through these and help you choose the hot water heater that will best match your needs for hot water output while maximizing the efficiency of the utility source from which it runs.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>
<p>A local plumbing company such as Atlas Home Services eliminates the guesswork—and the hassle—around replacing your old water heater. By some estimates, a tankless hot water heater uses 22% less energy than its traditional counterpart. Whether you are in of water heater repairs or you're interested in upgrading to a newer, more efficient tankless model, our expert plumbing technicians can help. Check the Energy Factor (EF) to see how efficient the unit is. A higher EF rating indicates better efficiency.</p>
<h3>Local Hot Water Heater Installation Palo Alto</h3>
<p>The two most important areas you have to focus on when installing a tankless water heater are making sure you have the right size fittings and that you have a proper ventilation system set up for the unit. If you live in an area such as Dallas, with hard water, then be sure to call an experienced licensed Dallas plumber to thoroughly check your water heater on a regular basis. A basic solar water heater system can cost $1,000-$4,000 to install, minus possible tax credits of up to 30% off the cost.</p>
<p>When you are ready for your shower you push a button and the pump sends the heated water from your water heater to your fixture more quickly than if you run the shower at full blast, and the pump shuts off when the hot water reaches it. Thus you save time, water, energy, and money. Tank heaters must always keep water warm after heating it. This process means that they continuously cycle on and off to keep water warm.</p>
<p>Sometimes water heaters will stop working when a pilot light goes out or if a part malfunctions. That's why the performance of tankless water heaters is measured by how many gallons per minute (GPM) the heater will deliver at a desired Temperature Rise. Larger units can heat water for your entire house. A tankless water heater not only eliminates the need for a bulky storage tank, it's a great way to reduce your household energy costs.</p>

With new water heater efficiency standards, we now have the opportunity to have it all.

Most water heaters are gas, so even the smallest of mistakes made during installation can cause added expenses, property damage, injury, or even death.</p>
<p>The benefits to installing tankless water heaters are numerous, but it's important to choose the right tankless water heater for your needs. Don't be shy about asking a retailer why the tankless water heater is discounted. So, over the typical duration of a unit, it will be a lot more efficient than a conventional tank-based heater. Once the old heater is done draining disconnect the gas pipe at the union fitting.</p>
<p>The main advantage of using a tankless water heater system is that they eliminate the extra cost of keeping 40 to 50 gallons of water hot in a storage tank, so you waste less energy. Tankless water heaters only heat water on an as-needed basis and will never run out of hot water during normal operation. It may be time to consider a tankless system. When the gas fumes from a gas water heater travel up and out the draft diverter on top of the gas water heater, they go to the outside of your house through a vent.</p>
