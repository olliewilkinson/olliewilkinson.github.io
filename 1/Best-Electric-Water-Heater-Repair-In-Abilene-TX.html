<h2>Water Heater Services Abilene Texas</h2>
<p>The water heater is one of the most important pieces of equipment that anyone has at their home. Since almost all tankless heaters are designed to maintain a desired outlet temperature, they have to restrict the flow through the heat exchanger to do so. This means that there is a limit to how much hot water they can provide at a given temperature rise or "Delta T". Basically, if you try to use more hot water at one time than the heater can provide it will limit the output volume to maintain the desired temperature.</p>
<p>If the water heater is located in an attic, water damage can result in every ceiling and floor beneath the water heater. Your water requirements will also have to be considered when choosing a tankless water heater. Our GoHot tankless heater is only the size of a briefcase. Since we are talking about electric tankless, the only thing I will say about gas models is that they almost always have better performance than electric models.</p>
<p>While most homeowners are used to their tanked system, a tankless water heater offers improved performance while saving on energy costs. Configuration of water heater: some electrical systems and configurations may need to be updated to accommodate the voltage requirements of the new electric tankless system. Open a faucet to full "hot" to purge air from the water pipes and heater. We'll make sure the tankless heating units you select have the proper capacity and best feature set to support the hot water requirements of your specific industry.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Abilene</h3>
<p>If they don't line up, solder elbow joints to the water heater's copper pipes to get them to connect seamlessly. There is no viable hot water heater repair for a leaking tank. As a general requirement, you should not install a water heater in any location where gasoline, flammable vapors or liquids, and combustible materials are likely to be present. Our plumbers have the experience and training to install, maintain, and service gas, electric, and tankless water heaters.</p>
<p>If there's too much scale buildup in the pipes, or faucet and showerhead aerators are clogged, or a turned-down faucet reduces water flow to about 0.3 gpm, these units automatically shut off. Heat Pump Water Heater: The energy factor of a heat pump water heater is more than twice the efficiency of a standard electric water heater. Can help you move into the future with a tankless water heater installation.</p>
<p>Electric tankless units can potentially help you save on home energy use and provide continuous hot water on demand. Leaks - If you're finding water around the base of your hot water tank, then your water heater has most likely already corroded beyond the ability for a repair. It's Making Noise - As your water heats, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. Some of them have the anode installed in a separate opening on top of the tank and some use a combination anode rod that is installed in the hot water outlet of the tank.</p>
<p>Consequently, the exhaust vent can be PVC or polypropylene and not metal, a feature that can lower the cost of installation. Our trained and certified plumbers will provide you with an honest, upfront price on the cost to install a tankless water heater ($29 or FREE if you choose us to install your water heater). For safety reasons, the water heater should not be on air conditioning lines or under pipes that can drip.</p>
<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Abilene TX</h3>
<p>Water heaters are heavy - use a helper, appliance dolly or hand truck when moving the appliance. Next, touch the water heater's temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve and the hot water outlet pipe above the water heater (see water heater diagrams above ). Some electric water heater problems may be more serious, however. If only the hot water is discolored or smelly, it's because there's a high concentration of sulfates or other minerals in your tank.</p>

Trouble is, it's often hard to tell whether rust is coming from the water heater itself or the pipes that lead to your faucet. Call us right away to check it out, and we'll determine whether a repair or replacement is needed.</p>
