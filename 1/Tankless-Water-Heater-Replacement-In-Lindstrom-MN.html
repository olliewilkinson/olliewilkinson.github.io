<p>Determining whether you should repair your water heater or purchase a new one depends solely on what is wrong with it in the first place. They know from experience which models of heaters tend to hold up the best to the hard water.

As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>
