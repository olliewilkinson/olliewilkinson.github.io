<h2>Water Heater Services Magnolia Arkansas</h2>
<p>The only time most people really spend thinking about their water heaters is in the middle of winter, when they get up in the dark to take a hot shower and they're blasted with a jet of icy water. Regardless of the power source, the water stored in their tank will remain hot for several days. If there's a major problem with your water heater or it's more than 12-15 years old, it may be time to consider a new one. On average, natural gas and propane models have an installation cost of around $1,000 to $1,500. These advancements have significantly increased the number of available residential and commercial hot water heating solutions.</p>
<p>Although it rarely happens, explosions are a serious risk with tank-style water heaters. A gas-powered tankless system has to use burners just like a tank system. However, they're also more costly to install and may struggle to provide hot water to multiple fixtures or appliances simultaneously. Tank water heaters are a common type of water heater. While they can be much more expensive than traditional units, tankless water heaters do deliver big long-term savings.</p>
<p>Hot water tanks typically last an average of 10 years, with variables like the condition of your water supply and frequency of preventative maintenance playing significant roles in your system's useful life. A water heater that's right for you. Connect with dedicated hoses the hot water outlet and the cold water inlet via the pressure relief valve. While your choice of water heater will cause a greater or lesser upfront cost, over time this will all average out to where you end up paying about the same over five years.</p>

<p>Tankless heaters can last up to 20 years but need to be maintained at least once a year. Once the water turns off, so does the tankless unit, saving energy and reducing wear and tear. As your water heater pulls water in, it's common that traces of sediment will deposit onto the bottom of your tank.

<p>However, they can reduce energy consumption by as much as 30 percent, by only heating water when it is needed rather than keeping a tank of hot water constantly heated. This is known as standby energy loss and it's costing you money. Tankless water heaters, also known as "on demand" heaters, heat water without a storage tank, using energy only when needed - rather than maintaining a tank of hot water. Tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, make hot water only when you need it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when added to homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water every day, according to They also last about twice as long as a tank water heater.</p>

<p>Modern units are much more energy efficient however, so consider the money you will save on utility costs when deciding whether to repair or replace yours. Have an assistant help load the old water heater onto the appliance dolly and remove the old unit. In other installations, the solar tank is set up alongside an existing hot water tank, and the solar water preheats water for the main hot water tank. Our water heater repairs and replacements are reasonably priced and affordable, so you can rest assured that we won't bring you any hidden surprises.</p>
<p>Check for leaks by turning on the gas supply valve and brushing a soapy water solution onto the gas union and all gas joints. Not only are they highly efficient, but they can also save you money by heating water only on-demand. Used for decades in Europe where living space is at a premium, tankless water heaters are a safe and reliable way to use less energy. What can go wrong: A single tankless heater may not have sufficient capacity to supply hot water to multiple locations at the same time.</p>
<p>The rate of hot water produced by a tankless water heater is two to five gallons per minute, depending on the heating style used. The very same holds true for refurbished tankless water heaters. Installing a water heater costs $800 and $1,506, or an average of $1,125, including the unit and labor. On average, you can expect your tankless water heater unit to last a minimum of 20 years before it needs major repairs and replacement.</p>

<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>
<p>If you ever see boiling water coming out of your faucet, or can see steam, you need to turn off your heater immediately and get a professional to inspect it. Boiling water usually means that the thermostat is broken and is overheating. We eliminate the stress and fear of replacing your water heater, by making the repair a fast, friendly, and comfortable experience. This means that the cause is somewhere between the water heater and the fixtures.</p>
