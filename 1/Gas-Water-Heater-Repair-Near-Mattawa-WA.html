<h2>Water Heater Services Mattawa Washington</h2>
<p>If you are thinking of replacing your gas tank-style unit with a tankless model, you should consider an outdoor installation. An electric water heater has an upper and a lower heating element. Storage tank: Storage tank water heaters typically have a capacity of 30 to 60 gallons, but the most common size is 50 gallons. The disadvantage with this tankless gas heater is that it takes a few seconds before hot water starts flowing. You don't know how old the water heater is or when it was last serviced. If all of these advantages sound good to you, call us today at 423-718-7342 for tankless water heater installation services.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing. If the water is still as hot as it was before you turned the temperature down, it's because the thermostat isn't working. That's why it's important to regularly maintain and, if necessary, repair your hot water tank — and that's a task that AirPlus Heating & Cooling can assist you with. It is important to know what you have as well as the benefits and disadvantages to making water heater changes, which is why our friendly technicians are here to help.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair Mattawa</h3>
<p>If your water comes out smelling like rotten eggs, there could be bacteria in the hot water heater tank. In our Chicago climate we experience extremely cold weather that can occasionally cause a main water line or incorrectly installed tankless water heater to freeze and prevent water from flowing. However, tankless water heaters are more energy efficient because you're only heating water as you need it. A water heater with a tank needs energy to heat up to 100 gallons, for example, and then needs energy to keep it hot all day long or until it's used.</p>
<p>If the temperature sensor (9) detects that the water exceeds or falls short of the desired setting, the panel will adjust the gas valve, the mixing valve, and the flow-regulating water valve (10) accordingly. Water heater problems are a good example of when this choice is important. Along with our furnaces and boilers, our water heaters are also available in various styles, efficiency levels, and brands - one of which includes the Navien brand.</p>
<p>However, if you're considering an electric tankless water heater, you'll need to make sure your home's electric panel can handle the added load.
