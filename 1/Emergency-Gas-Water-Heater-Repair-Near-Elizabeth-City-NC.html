Listed below are the warranty phone numbers for the top water heater manufacturers - be sure to have your model number and serial number handy prior to beginning your call.</p>

If your hot water tank is over 15 years old, it's at the end of its natural life and you're better off getting a new one. You expect the best for your home, family and business, so it makes sense to trust the #1 selling gas tankless water heating brand in North America for all of your water heating needs.</p>
