<p>Compact tankless water heaters only heat water when you need it. This type of heater uses gas burners or electric coils to heat water on demand. Plus you need a wye, not a T where the water heater and furnace connect. These units provide on demand” performance since they don't have a storage tank. Nevertheless, it's something just about everyone must deal with at some point or another because no water heating system lasts forever.</p>
<p>Let's say you have 3 water fixtures close together and have determined that one tankless system will be purchased for serving these fixtures. Higher installation cost: The upfront cost to install a new tankless water heater is more than a conventional storage tank system. These units, which heat water with thick copper rods, are quieter and about a third smaller than gas or propane tankless heaters. Compared with a tank-type heater costing $400 or so, a $1,000 tankless gas heater may save a household only about $100 per year, depending on how efficient it is and how much hot water is used.</p>
<p>There are several common complaints we hear everyday about Bucks County water heaters. Tankless water heaters are much more energy efficient than tank-based water heaters. Tank-style water heaters may be the most common, but the truth is they're not without flaws. If you have a smaller family, or you're just a couple without kids then we have a unit for you as well in a smaller capacity energy-efficient unit that will keep the hot water coming.</p>
<p>The most popular brands of water heaters are reliable, affordable, have good value and are always available. While tankless water heaters run more efficiently than storage tank water heaters, replacing a tank water heater with a tankless can be expensive, and the payback time can be longer than the warranty. An undersized water heater may also be the problem if too much water is being used to heat it adequately.</p>
<p>Once your plumber arrives, he or she will talk with you about what has been going on with your water heater. There will be either a lever or knob on one of the water pipes coming out of the wall to the water heater. Use dielectric fittings when connecting copper pipe to steel water heater connections. As long as your unit is the right capacity for the number of people in your home, that should mean no one ever has to settle for cold or lukewarm water again.</p>
