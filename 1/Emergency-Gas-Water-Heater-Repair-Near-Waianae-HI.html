<h2>Water Heater Services Waianae Hawaii</h2>
<p>The water heater is one of the most important pieces of equipment that anyone has at their home. Since almost all tankless heaters are designed to maintain a desired outlet temperature, they have to restrict the flow through the heat exchanger to do so. This means that there is a limit to how much hot water they can provide at a given temperature rise or "Delta T". Basically, if you try to use more hot water at one time than the heater can provide it will limit the output volume to maintain the desired temperature.</p>
<p>The recommended water heater setting of about 115-120 degrees, it keeps your water heater from overheating and save a lot of electricity.
