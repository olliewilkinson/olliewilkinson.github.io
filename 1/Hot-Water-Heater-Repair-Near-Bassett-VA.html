<h2>Water Heater Services Bassett Virginia</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Your water heater is your last defense for dealing with freezing cold water, which is why you should always stay on top of regular maintenance and care.
