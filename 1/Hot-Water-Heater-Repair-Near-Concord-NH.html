VIP Plumbing's prompt, courteous, and professional service technicians will fix all of your plumbing problems, and put your mind at ease. Because the old style had a tank full of water, every time the water in the tank drops below a certain temperature, the heating element turns on, heating the water back up, even if you aren't using it. With an inline heater, it only comes on when in use, and when you aren't using the hot water, the unit shuts off until needed again.</p>
<p>It's important to understand that water heaters, like all appliances, eventually wear out. The activation of a faucet requiring hot water activates the heater and water is heated as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. If you notice physical damage to your water heater, call us for hot water tank repair right away. Many people wonder when to replace a water heater and when to repair it.
