<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation Kaplan</h3>
<p>If the heating element burns out, there's no heat to apply to the water. Once this occurs, it is necessary for a replacement to occur and to contact your local plumbing contractor. When sized appropriately, a constant supply of hot water is delivered to your home with ease. But you'll need to deal with pipes, gas lines or electrical. If your repairs are more frequent, it's better to put that money toward a new heater.</p>
<p>Low or no hot water: Whether caused by sediment build-up, malfunctioning heating systems, or broken dip tubes, your water heater may fail to produce hot water or the temperature will be lower than normal. If your water heater is not getting power, be sure to turn off the circuit breaker BEFORE checking your electrical connections. A cross connection can occur in a failing shower valve (or any mixing valve) that allows cold water to pass to the hot side, letting cold water into the hot water pipe.</p>

With an electric hot water heater, several other components could be causing you to lose hot water. Solar water heaters work using roof-mounted solar panels that absorb the sun's heat and transfer it to an antifreeze-like fluid in a closed-loop system that runs to the water tank and heats the water.</p>

Increasingly, consumers are turning to tankless water heaters for their many benefits. Tankless units are susceptible to failure due to hard water. Just keep in mind that water heaters have a typical life span of 10 to 15 years.
