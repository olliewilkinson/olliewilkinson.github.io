<p>Cleaner water - A tankless unit provides cleaner water too. Energy conservation is a great feature of on-demand tankless water heaters, but it's not the only great feature.

We care about your home's plumbing system and want to make sure your water heater is running properly.</p>

This provides an endless supply of hot water regardless of how many people need to take showers, how much laundry needs to get done, or how often you need to run the dishwasher. Wrap a rag around the heating element to keep water from dripping down. One is to store it in a tank and heat it up there; this is what conventional heaters do. Another way is to heat water as it passes through the pipes -tankless heaters work this way.</p>

New systems are often more reliable as well, so you won't have to worry about running out of hot water at inconvenient times.</p>

Even when there is no demand, the water must be reheated every time the temperature falls below the thermostat threshold. When the stored water cools due to standby heat loss, a thermostat in the tank triggers the reheating process.

They do this by running the water across a series of heating elements and then directly to your faucet.

<p>A lot goes into installation, including safety, plumbing permits from the county, and gas, electrical, or other connections.

<p>Gas water heaters will have a higher FHR compared to an electric heater with the same sized tank. It's estimated that gas water heaters last for up to 10 years and electric ones up to 15 ‚ but don't think you don't have to maintain and troubleshoot certain things about your hot water heater to meet, or even exceed, these projected lifetimes. The installation process is more time-consuming, and fewer plumbers know how to install them correctly.</p>
<p>Depending on the service load of your home, you may need an electrician to install a larger breaker to provide you with enough power. Most tank-style water heaters won't live past 20 years. Press the probe tips against the terminals of the heating element (one probe to each screw). Energy efficiency of your water heater can be improved through its correct installation and maintenance.
