<p>Gas water heaters will have a higher FHR compared to an electric heater with the same sized tank. It's estimated that gas water heaters last for up to 10 years and electric ones up to 15 ‚ but don't think you don't have to maintain and troubleshoot certain things about your hot water heater to meet, or even exceed, these projected lifetimes. The installation process is more time-consuming, and fewer plumbers know how to install them correctly.</p>
<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
