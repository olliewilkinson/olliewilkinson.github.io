<p>It'll take about 20 to 30 minutes to completely drain a 40 gallon water heater. Keep in mind that the tank size you need should be based on the maximum amount of hot water you will need during busy times, not on the storage room available for it. In some cases, you may have to switch to an outdoor model is the size you need can't be accommodated in the space available inside your home. There are several different factors worth considering before purchasing a new water heater.</p>
<p>If you have water on the floor or on top of the unit (this is different from water leaking from a supply line above the unit), you'll probably need a new water heater.

A unit that requires cleaning, maintenance, or repair will struggle to meet your hot water demands.</p>
<p>There are situations where your heater could break before it is old, however, and in these scenarios we might try repairing it.
