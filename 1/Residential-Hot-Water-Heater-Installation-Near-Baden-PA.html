<p>For homes that use 41 gallons of water or less, tankless water heaters can be 24% to 34% more energy efficient. The tankless water heater usually heats water directly without requiring the use of a storage tank. These types of heaters have a lot of mechanical parts and need a professional to troubleshoot.

<p>There are situations where your heater could break before it is old, however, and in these scenarios we might try repairing it.

<p>But likewise, even though the problem may be similar, the repair solution is considerably different from a traditional tank heater. We'll consider whether you prefer gas or electric service, how much hot water your property demands, and how much available space you have for a new tank.

If you're not getting hot water, it could be the heating element or another maintenance issue.

With many water pipes hooking to your heater and home's plumbing systems, you could cause more damage than good if you accidentally unscrew the wrong pipe.

<p>If the supply lines (gas and water) need to be moved that is the first major issue, then you have to think about the other details: replacing the exhaust pipe, a new concrete slab, a metal shed, earthquake straps, exhaust straps, and not to mention any flooring, ceiling and roofing repairs along with some hefty patchwork. Then your hot water tank is suddenly on the forefront of your mind. At Heil Plumbing, we constantly update our products to give homeowners and builders efficient water heater systems.</p>
