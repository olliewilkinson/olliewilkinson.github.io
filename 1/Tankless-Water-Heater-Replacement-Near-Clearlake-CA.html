<h2>Water Heater Services Clearlake California</h2>
<p>Here are some suggestions on how to perform water heater repair. Most traditional water heaters sit in a closet for easy access; tankless models may need to have an access door added nearby in case of future issues to allow quick repair. Set up your tankless water heater installation in the Pittsburg and Antioch, CA area today. A whole house unit would be installed in a central location and completely replaces a standard tank water heater. Ideally, a full flush will be performed, but in which case the heater has to be turned off beforehand and the tank has to be full.</p>
<p>Propane is available as both traditional tank water heaters starting at $560, and tankless products beginning around $600, other options include a single, wall-mounted, tankless, 1.5 GPM shower unit with a battery powered igniter and a showerhead for approximately $110. A tankless water heater may be the right option for you. Currently, there is too little data to accurately estimate life expectancy for tankless water heaters, but preliminary data shows that tankless water heaters could last up to 20 years.</p>
<p>A local plumbing company such as Atlas Home Services eliminates the guesswork—and the hassle—around replacing your old water heater. By some estimates, a tankless hot water heater uses 22% less energy than its traditional counterpart.

By contrast, installing a conventional electric water heater is within your reach… Provided that you possess some experience in plumbing and electricity. Because the tankless water heater is going to only give the hot water as it is needed instead of having it sit in the tank all the time waiting for you to use it. Then you will not need to worry about having any one getting burnt because they were messing around the hot water tank when they should have not been.</p>
<p>Although still an efficient enough way to heat water, some of the problems cited with these storage tank water heaters include the heated water limits, the heating delays and maintenance problems.

<p>Gas-powered water heaters must vent out combustion fumes safely from the system.

You can control the output temperature directly on the tankless water heater, so you know how hot the water is delivered to your taps will be.
