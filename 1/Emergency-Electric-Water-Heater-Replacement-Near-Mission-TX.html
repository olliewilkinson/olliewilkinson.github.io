<p>Do you need water heater repair for your gas system? Venting of current hot water heater: via chimney or through the wall. All costs are for the unit only, this does not include installation, transportation or additional costs. A tankless water heater typically relies on an in-line filter to prevent sediment and other solids from entering and clogging the heat exchanger. Price with installation: Varies dramatically depending on the type, brand, your home, and whether you are installing a new heater or replacing an old one.</p>
<p>While tankless water heaters cost more upfront, they help you save so much water that the costs you save from your reduced water bill can actually pay off your unit in just a few years. This may force someone down the cost-saving route before they've fully considered the benefits of a tankless system. Since in many instances you purge the cooled off hot water from the hot lines before you use the hot fixture, you want the hot piping from the heater to the fixtures to be as short as possible.</p>

For all of your plumbing needs - from emergencies to routine maintenance - call Reliability Home Services at (443) 399-8663. Unlimited hot water: While traditional water heaters are limited to the amount of hot water in the tank, tankless units can provide unlimited hot water.</p>

<p>Gas water heaters will have a higher FHR compared to an electric heater with the same sized tank. It's estimated that gas water heaters last for up to 10 years and electric ones up to 15 ‚ but don't think you don't have to maintain and troubleshoot certain things about your hot water heater to meet, or even exceed, these projected lifetimes.

<p>Use channel-type pliers or a pipe wrench to loosen and disconnect the lines from the water heater. Over time, water heaters often suffer from sediment build-up that can damage the tank. For example, a sudden loss of hot water may mean that the pilot has gone out. Be sure to connect the cold water pipe to the cold water inlet on the water heater. Cold water enters the tank and is heated by an electric element or gas burner.</p>
