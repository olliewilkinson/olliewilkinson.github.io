<h2>Water Heater Services Bad Axe Michigan</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>If you currently have a gas system then purchase a tankless water heater system that also operates on gas. Plumbing-supply stores, big-box stores, and online retailers all carry these heaters. By periodically draining the water heater tank and having a thorough rinse performed by our professionals, you'll be able to keep mineral buildup to a minimum. Consequently, the lack of maintenance plays a big role in repair costs and necessity.</p>
<p>Coat the threaded ends with pipe joint compound and screw the first nipple into the gas valve. We've taken a closer look at the best tank versus tankless heaters so you can narrow your search and find the perfect water heater for your home and lifestyle. Periodic water heater maintenance can significantly extend your water heater's life and minimize loss of efficiency. Water heaters are heavy.

You're also not as limited when it comes to where your tankless water heater can be installed as they're safer. In addition to choosing a water heater with a good warranty, check consumer reporting websites and reviews from individual owners. The first step is to find an appropriate wall to mount the water heater to. For a whole house water heater, it makes sense to place it close to where most hot water is being used.</p>
<p>Low or no hot water: Whether caused by sediment build-up, malfunctioning heating systems, or broken dip tubes, your water heater may fail to produce hot water or the temperature will be lower than normal. If your water heater is not getting power, be sure to turn off the circuit breaker BEFORE checking your electrical connections. A cross connection can occur in a failing shower valve (or any mixing valve) that allows cold water to pass to the hot side, letting cold water into the hot water pipe.</p>
