If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive.

<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as demand-type or instantaneous water heaters, provide hot water only as it is needed. As shown in the photo, a tankless water heater has its components housed in a steel box that's designed to be mounted on the wall. This means as long as you have water flowing, and don't run out of whatever fuel (propane, electricity, etc.) you use to generate the heat; you have continuous hot water.</p>

Since the issue just started after you installed the tankless water heater, I would highly recommend calling the water heater company and asking them to come to take a look.</p>
<p>Lower temperatures have also been proven to make your tankless gas water heater last longer because less minerals and corrosion will build up. Consider insulating your water heater pipes as well, especially if the water is traveling three feet or more from the unit's location. The approach is consistent for tankless water heaters.
