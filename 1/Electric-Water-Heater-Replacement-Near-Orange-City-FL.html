<h2>Water Heater Services Orange City Florida</h2>
<p>The water heater is an immensely important fixture in your house. You can try raising the temperature on the water heater, as discussed directly above. Once the water in the top part of the tank has reached the temperature value determined by the top thermostat setting, the top thermostat (is considered "satisfied") switches power from the top element to the lower thermostat. We can help guide you through these and help you choose the hot water heater that will best match your needs for hot water output while maximizing the efficiency of the utility source from which it runs.</p>
<p>Your water heater is your last defense for dealing with freezing cold water, which is why you should always stay on top of regular maintenance and care. Whether it's powered by electricity or natural gas, your water heater isn't built to last forever. Once the system is all hooked up and properly tested, you're ready to start using your new water heating system. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that in homes using 41 gallons or less of hot water, on-demand tankless units can conserve between 24% to 34% more energy than tank water heaters.</p>
<p>Direct vent heaters are slightly higher in efficiency over standard water heaters but are significantly less efficient than tankless water heaters. The statistical life expectancy of a storage tank water heater is 10-12 years, depending on care and maintenance. For those suffering from a leaky water heater, John Moore can even repair your water damaged walls and floors without the headache of dealing with multiple contractors.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Replacement Orange City</h3>
<p>If your family has grown larger or smaller, this is a good time to consider upsizing or downsizing your water heater. A traditional water heater stores hot water in a large tank. You'll need to have the water heater cleaned out, but we also strongly recommend installing a water softener to eliminate the problem at the source. With tankless electric water heaters, there is a direct relationship between the flow rate of a fixture (demand), the power supplied to the tankless electric water heater, and the output temperature of the hot water.</p>

<p>If it's time for a replacement, we will help you determine the best option according to the design of your home and your family's needs and budget.

<p>2. Electrical tankless water heaters can require upgraded electrical service of much higher amperage than you currently have. When replacing a water heater it's easiest to keep the same fuel type and roughly the same size, although you can usually change the size a bit — for example, from 40 to 50 gallons, provided there is enough room for the heater. Your energy savings depends on the amount of water you use and the efficiency of your previous tank-style system.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, you're bound to see signs that your water heater needs to be replaced. A gas heater has a burner underneath the tank while electric heaters have an element in the tank to heat the water. We offer same day service and convenient appointments so you never have to wait around when you're in need, and we provide all our plumbers with fully stocked trucks so they can take care of repairs on the first trip.</p>

When you turn on a hot water valve or an appliance that draws hot water such as a washing machine or dishwasher, the gas-fired tankless water heater will draw cold water in through the cold-water inlet pipe on one side.</p>
<p>Tankless water heating systems effectively cancels out the standby heat losses made by storage type heaters. However, in that 30 plus year span, it has been determined that tankless water heaters can be expected to last for 20 years or more with minimal care and maintenance being required. While these units will similarly fuel your system, the main differences occur in operating cost. Plumbers are pros at fitting pipes and stopping leaks, but that doesn't mean they can troubleshoot electrical problems, adjust gas pressures, or monitor combustion safety.</p>
