<h2>Water Heater Services Dobson North Carolina</h2>
<p>Although water heaters typically last for a number of years, they do need to be replaced from time to time. A tankless water heater is an excellent option for modern homes: they can keep up with the demand of the majority of households (provided they're sized correctly), cut down on energy bills, and won't run out of hot water the way standard storage tank water heaters do. We are proud to offer top quality installations of tankless water heaters in Bethesda, MD and throughout our wide service area. I don't think there's a best” time to buy a new water heater, but as with any appliance, around major holidays (Labor Day, Memorial Day, etc.) are usually good times.</p>
<p>Gas hot water system installation cost is typically between $250 and $700 to replace an old hot water system with the same type in the same spot. With a tankless water heater, there is no tank to heat up, so the supply of hot water is endless.

<p>It might seem like it would be easy to install a water heater, but it is actually a lot more complex than it looks. According to , For homes that use 41 gallons or less of hot water daily, demand (or tankless) water heaters can be 24% to 34% more energy efficient than conventional storage tank water heaters.” Tankless water heaters (if gas-fired) will save homeowners over $100 annually the longer they remain in service.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement Dobson</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters are still unusual in the U.S., where tank-type water heaters have been used for many years. Although a second unit might seem like a large investment, it can actually save you money in the long run since you'll use less water while waiting for hot water to arrive and less gas to heat the water. A tankless gas water heater needs a gas line to the water heater, and the unit must be vented to the outside.</p>
<p>The new tankless water heaters are great for providing you with hot water instantly by heating the water right inside of the pipe as soon as you turn the faucet on. While they are more expensive than traditional units, the amount of money you will save on your water bill and your electricity or gas bill will be well worth the added investment. Storage tank water heaters have an energy factor of 0.59, on average.</p>
<p>Check the surrounding pipes for leaks that could damage the water heater. After the hot water tank in the system is an expansion tank installed to help keep pressure levels in the system at safe levels. Even when well-maintained, a tank-style heater will only last up to about 15 years, which means you'll have to spend even more replacing it. One of the most important, but also most unnoticed, appliances in your home is your water heater.</p>
