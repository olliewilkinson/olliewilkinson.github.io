<h2>Water Heater Services Lithia Florida</h2>
<p>Not many of us know a whole lot about water heaters or water heater repair. Electric heaters are often cheaper to purchase and the spare parts needed for repairs are usually easy to find and cheap to buy. Water heaters are one of the unsung heroes of the plumbing world. By no means does this list include everything that is and should be checked on a water heating system but, hopefully, it will help you to know more about your system than you knew before and protect you from harm. ENERGY STAR certified models are available for water heater tanks.</p>
<p>It'll cost you anywhere from $300 to $2,000 for a hot water tank style heater. Depending on your location and other components, you have several choices for powering your new water heater. Some people say that tankless installation is more expensive, and for some this may be true. Drain the water from the tank and unscrew the old element using a heating element wrench. And that's not the only benefit they provide: they take up a lot less space, have a longer lifespan, save energy because they don't have to keep a tank full of water heated around the clock, and ultimately save you money in operating costs in the long run.</p>
<p>Water heater type: Whole-home tankless units provide hot water to all plumbing fixtures in your home, while point-of-use (POU) units only provide hot water for a single appliance or area (like the kitchen or laundry room). The tankless heater is much smaller than a traditional tank water heater. Longer useful lives than storage tank water heaters. Many homeowners in Fort Wayne, IN are switching to a tankless water heater.</p>

<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Lithia FL</h3>
<p>Many homeowners, however, see benefits of a tankless water heater beyond energy savings. If you are looking for a 55+ gallon electric tank water heater, you will have to purchase a hybrid or heat pump, or a condensate tank if your fuel type is natural gas. Tankless water heaters work in almost any environment when mounted inside or outside your home or business. A water heater expansion tank costs $40 to $200 with labor adding another $50 to $150.</p>
<p>There are situations where your heater could break before it is old, however, and in these scenarios we might try repairing it.

<p>The water storage tank works in a very simple way; at the top of the tank are two feed pipes, one for cold water the other for the hot water. Whether gas or electric, tankless water heaters heat water only as it is needed and may save up to 70 percent on a yearly heating bill. The tankless water heater heats the water when it is required. These traditional heaters can be exhausted and take a long time to refill and reheat.</p>
<p>But … tankless water heaters may still encounter repair needs that will require calling on a professional plumber.

<p>If your water heater is in a location that will not cause damage if there is a leak, you can wait until it develops a leak before replacing it, but that really is not recommended. The amount you pay for service goes towards your replacement. In addition, we are trained to repair and install commercial tankless water heater and commercial water heater systems. Luckily, hot water heaters are fairly simple and don't have a lot of moving parts.</p>
<p>Some of these heaters are more energy efficient than other kinds. The purchase price of gas powered heaters may be a little bit higher, but they are cheaper to operate overall. Also, since combustion takes place in the heating process using gas there needs to be adequate ventilation for both combustion (fresh air flow) and exhaust. Beehive Plumbing has the necessary experience and tools to handle all water heater repair, whether they're commercial or residential.</p>
