<h2>Water Heater Services Liberty Missouri</h2>
<p>When it comes to a clean burning fuel source to supply your hot water requirements as well as a quick recovery time, a natural gas water heater can certainly take care of your needs. Their line of AquaStar tankless water heaters continue to set the standard with an efficiency range of 80% - 87%. So long as all is well, you should have hot water in no time. One drawback to electric units is its limited output, which tops out at 36 kilowatts, or about 123,000 Btus. When you're interested in installing a tankless water heater, we come to your home, inspect your plumbing system, and lay out a road map for exactly how your installation will work.</p>
<p>It'll cost you anywhere from $300 to $2,000 for a hot water tank style heater. Depending on your location and other components, you have several choices for powering your new water heater. Some people say that tankless installation is more expensive, and for some this may be true. Drain the water from the tank and unscrew the old element using a heating element wrench. And that's not the only benefit they provide: they take up a lot less space, have a longer lifespan, save energy because they don't have to keep a tank full of water heated around the clock, and ultimately save you money in operating costs in the long run.</p>
<p>This is a type of heater that provides hot water only as it is needed. In order for the top element to have voltage and heat the water, the temperature of the water in the top of the tank must be lower than the temperature setting of the top thermostat. Tankless gas models need to produce very high combustion temperatures so that they can instantaneously raise the temperature of incoming cold water to the desired temperature.</p>
