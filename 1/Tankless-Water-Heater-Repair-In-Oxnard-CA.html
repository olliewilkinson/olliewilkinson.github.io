<h2>Water Heater Services Oxnard California</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Water heaters need their own electrical circuits. If there is no hot water in the water heater, this may be because of a lack of power to heating the elements, such as tripped circuit breaker, a blown fuse handling water heater circuit, a faulty electric thermostat, or a faulty upper electric heating element. The good news is that newer hot water heaters aren't overly expensive and they will last for over a decade, making them a very good investment.</p>
<p>Direct vent heaters are slightly higher in efficiency over standard water heaters but are significantly less efficient than tankless water heaters. The statistical life expectancy of a storage tank water heater is 10-12 years, depending on care and maintenance.

Along with our furnaces and boilers, our water heaters are also available in various styles, efficiency levels, and brands - one of which includes the Navien brand.</p>
<p>If you're using a gas-powered water heater, the burner assembly must be connected to the gas line.

<p>Problems such as rusty or discolored water, strange noises or low or no heat are also indicators it's time to get your water heater repaired or replaced. A tankless water heater is also called an "on-demand" water heater, because it only heats water when you turn on the hot water tap. Tankless water heaters take up very little space because they have no capacity to store water; instead, cold water is piped through a heat exchanger and heated to a preset temperature range.</p>
<p>If the pressure is much lower now, you either need to limit your hot water demand or ask a plumber about upgrading your tankless water heater. When problems arise with your home's hot water tank, you want a licensed plumber to always take care of the problem. If a professional plumber installed a closed system, it is unlikely that an expansion chamber or tank was not installed at the same time. At Gold Medal Service, we are committed to doing everything we can to restore your water heater to optimal performance.</p>
<p>Since tankless heaters warm water on demand, they use much less energy. Professional advice and tips are provided in tankless water heater reviews posted on the pages of Web zines or "blogs".

Ruud who invented the electric water heater (automatic storage) in 1889, founded the Ruud Manufacturing Company, which is still in operation today, and pioneered the advancement of them, in both the residential and commercial market.</p>

As long as these needs are met, it is convenient for tankless water heating to take place in the bathroom. These water heaters operate in tandem with your home heating system and are often seen in conjunction with boilers. There are ways to prevent sediment buildup, including regular maintenance, using a water softener to reduce the number of contaminants in your water, and keeping your overall water heater temperature at or below 130 degrees.</p>
<p>If the supply lines (gas and water) need to be moved that is the first major issue, then you have to think about the other details: replacing the exhaust pipe, a new concrete slab, a metal shed, earthquake straps, exhaust straps, and not to mention any flooring, ceiling and roofing repairs along with some hefty patchwork. Then your hot water tank is suddenly on the forefront of your mind. At Heil Plumbing, we constantly update our products to give homeowners and builders efficient water heater systems.</p>
