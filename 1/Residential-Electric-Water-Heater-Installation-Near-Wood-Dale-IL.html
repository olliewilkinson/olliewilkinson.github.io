<p>Whether you need a new water heater installation or some help with maintenance, you can trust our plumbing experts to help keep your home and family comfortable. Besides energy and cost savings, there are several other reasons to choose a tankless water heater over a traditional tank-style heater. Tankless units are complicated. Gas hot water not working is unusual, as gas hot water systems tend to be very reliable.</p>

You have a tight budget and installing a tankless water heater doesn't fall within that budget or doesn't work with your financing options.

The cost of heating water consumes almost 20 percent of your household budget, second only to what you spend on heating and cooling your home.</p>
<p>Instead, the water is heated when it passes through the system, which may be fuelled by gas or electricity. Typical home water heaters are the large storage types that take up a significant amount of room in the garage or basement. After a while fixing a leak-prone water heater can become costly. Our plumbers know that this can be stressful, but we are here to offer quick and effective water heater replacement service for your home or business.</p>
<p>While new storage water heaters are more efficient, they have had to grow in size. But if you have a large family, you'll likely need the faster heating capability of a gas unit. Call water heaters repair services. We see this a lot on traditional electric water heaters, which use a pair of electric heating elements to heat the tank. After your water heater tank has filled with water, turn on the circuit breaker at the main power box.</p>

With tankless water heaters, there's no storage hot water tank to leak or break, thus reducing the risk of flooding. Before making repairs or purchasing a new water heater, check the nameplate on the side of your current unit. Heating your water can use a lot of energy. If steam or excessively hot water shoots out of faucets, or you hear boiling sounds inside the water heater, the appliance may not be shutting off at its set temperature.</p>
