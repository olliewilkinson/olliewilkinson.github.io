<h2>Water Heater Services Lynchburg Virginia</h2>
<p>Need a Tank Water Heater Installation? At the very least, you could break even while reducing the number of times that you'll need to replace your water heater. While DIY repairs can save you some time and money, it can also be messy, and there's the risk of electrical exposure with certain repairs. You need to review the various gas hot water system options , including instant hot water system and hot water tank units, to choose the best type of hot water heater system replacement.</p>
<p>For a standard 40 gallon water heater you now only have about 34 gallons. The short delay between when the water starts to flow and when the heater kicks on causes a short burst of cold water before turning hot. Because methods for repairing the problem may depend on whether your water heater is gas or electric, these are discussed separately below. Electric Water Heater: For homes that are powered mainly by electricity, an electric water heater is likely the best option.</p>

In a large home, or if you have a big family and heavy water usage, you may need to install two or more tankless models. The main factor is the cost of the water heater itself. If you run a business whose core operations depend on providing the customers with hot water as part of the experience, going tankless is a necessity that directly connects to the bottom line.</p>

As a rule of thumb, water heaters are not designed to last much beyond about 10 to 15 years (more or less). The "largest" electric tankless heaters can't match the output of a "standard" gas tankless unit.</p>
<p>Lower temperatures have also been proven to make your tankless gas water heater last longer because less minerals and corrosion will build up. Consider insulating your water heater pipes as well, especially if the water is traveling three feet or more from the unit's location. The approach is consistent for tankless water heaters.
