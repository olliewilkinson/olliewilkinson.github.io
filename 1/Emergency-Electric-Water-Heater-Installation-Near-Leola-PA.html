<h2>Water Heater Services Leola Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>Usually, these tanks hold enough hot water to meet the needs of the entire house. When we install a new water heater, our water heater experts will ensure that any gas and electrical connections are handled safely, and the water heater is installed properly. Endless hot water and lower energy bills are two reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters. You can enjoy consistent hot water by scheduling professional service when it's needed.</p>
<p>When the hot water is being taken from a tank, the tank will be filled up with cold water, which will cool the temperature of the water that is available. The water heater tank is damaged or rusted. One of the most vital plumbing components in your home is the water heater. You need someone you can rely on when you say, Fix my water heater!” At Davis Home Services, that's the type of service we want to give you every time.</p>

<p>The worst traditional electric heaters are 93 percent efficient. Maybe your hot water heater has sprung a leak or it's just stopped working. If your home uses less than 42 gallons of hot water daily, a tankless water heater can operate up to 34 percent more efficiently than a storage tank water heater.

Storage tank water heaters last an average of 10-15 years, while tankless water heaters may last 20 years or more before suffering in performance due to age. While most homes will have traditional tanked units, tankless water heater systems are quickly gaining popularity, and for good reason. Compared to the 7.5 to 9.5 gallons per minute that storage tanks can pump out, tankless units average flow rates between 2.5 and 5 gallons per minute.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: Yes, most tankless water heater repairs require a professional. A great way to start changing the house from being less dependent on traditional energy sources and electricity companies to install solar hot water panels.

<p>This can save you a great deal of valuable storage room compared to other models of water heaters that are available. Installing tankless water heater will hardly take our plumbers much time. People with electric hot water heaters will see a greater cost reduction than those with natural gas heaters, but everyone will save money over time.

<p>From standard tank water heaters to tankless to solar water heaters, we have an option that will match your needs and save energy. Age: As a rule, if your water heater is more than ten years old, it's time to invest in a new water heater. As soon you turn off the water flow, the heater turns off. The traditional water heater keeps water hot 24 hours a day even you are at work or sleeping. Most tank-style water heaters last about eight to 12 years.</p>
