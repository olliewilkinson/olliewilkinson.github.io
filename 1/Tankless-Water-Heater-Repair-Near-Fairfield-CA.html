<h2>Water Heater Services Fairfield California</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Age- Most water heaters last roughly 10 - 15 years. A plumbing inspector will come to your place and look at the installation to make sure that the work was done properly. Rust: Anytime there's rust on the outside of your tank, around fittings, or in the water itself, you're water heater may be on its last legs. Solar power water heater systems use the sun's energy to generate warm water for your home. The compact designs of this kind of heater leaves space for a water softener or additional storage such as "use it as you need it".</p>

Today's plumbing code requires all tank-style water heaters to have a temperature and pressure relief valve that opens to release pressure and eliminate the possibility of the tank exploding. Traditional water heaters are easier and less costly to install, but they do cost more to run.</p>
