<h2>Water Heater Services West Memphis Arkansas</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>If the water heater is located in an attic, water damage can result in every ceiling and floor beneath the water heater. Your water requirements will also have to be considered when choosing a tankless water heater. Our GoHot tankless heater is only the size of a briefcase. Since we are talking about electric tankless, the only thing I will say about gas models is that they almost always have better performance than electric models.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the type of traditional hot water tank you had, you may be able to install it in the same area. In addition to high upfront costs, smaller tankless units don't always deliver enough hot water to appliances and showers simultaneously. Our 24-hour emergency plumbers offer a complete range of solutions that can get a faulty system back up and running in no time. Many homeowners are interested in how tankless water heaters can save them money, since these units are more energy efficient than their tank counterparts.</p>
<h3>Emergency Hot Water Heater Repair West Memphis</h3>
<p>In the event that this valve does not work then you know you will have to start looking for a replacement. Some residential water heaters seem to have been placed by chance rather function. Before you decide to purchase a new water heater, you may want to determine if it can, in fact, be repaired. Tankless water heaters can be sized to provide a continuous flow of hot water, making them suitable for large families that use a lot of hot water at one time.</p>
<p>Further, a tankless gas water heater has a life span of 10 to 15 years. If your water heater is no longer producing hot water, or if the tank is leaking, you need to take care of it right away. If the tankless system costs $2,200 installed, and saves $116 a year, it would take about 19 years to break even on the investment. Point-of-use units are used to quickly supply hot water to a source not located near the home's central water heater.</p>
<p>We serve Los Angeles - Orange County and surrounding Southern California neighborhoods for all your water heater repair and replacement needs.

<p>Petersen Plumbing does not recommend tankless water heaters in locations with hard well water, or where galvanized steel pipe is present either in the building, or in the water service to the building. Capacity: The size of on-demand water heaters should be based on the number of occupants in the home and their peak hour water demand, rather than the size of the house. Units that undergo routine checks and upgrades last longer and undergo less frequent and costly repairs.</p>
<p>Additional materials: some of the tankless systems will also be incompatible with the location and setup of older storage tank models.
