<h2>Water Heater Services Rockford Illinois</h2>
<p>The water heater is one of the most important pieces of equipment that anyone has at their home. Since almost all tankless heaters are designed to maintain a desired outlet temperature, they have to restrict the flow through the heat exchanger to do so. This means that there is a limit to how much hot water they can provide at a given temperature rise or "Delta T". Basically, if you try to use more hot water at one time than the heater can provide it will limit the output volume to maintain the desired temperature.</p>
<p>Gas tankless water heaters have a longer life expectancy than traditional tank water heaters. At Green Hills Plumbing we offer quality tankless water heater installation and service. Numerous people don't consider purchasing a new hot water heater until their old ones break down, yet the newer models could end up saving the home owner money in terms of energy expenditures so purchasing one now might save money for the household.</p>
