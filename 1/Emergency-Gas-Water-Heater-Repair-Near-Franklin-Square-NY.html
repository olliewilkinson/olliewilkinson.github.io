<h2>Water Heater Services Franklin Square New York</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>The size of the water heater must also be taken into account. Tankless: As their name implies, tankless, or on-demand water heaters, don't store water in a tank. No matter what your needs are surrounding tankless water heaters, we'll help you meet them and get the hot water you need. Heating systems harness electric or even solar energy. This means inspecting the water pipes connected to the water heater, cleaning any debris and dust, checking the thermostats and safety valves and flushing the system.</p>
<p>Whether you repair or replace, water heaters will perform better and last longer if you flush the tank once a year to remove sediment. If you are not 100% confident installing an electric water heater, Lowe's recommends that you hire a professional. Gas units are often a little higher costs for installation because of the venting required. If the water starts out in the middle of the heater for instance, it will leave the heater after only being in the pipe for half the time it would need to reach full temperature.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Replacement Franklin Square</h3>
<p>There is no way around it. And this is technology used in these tankless heaters is modern and hi-tech, but they produce one disadvantage that while CO2 emissions are reduced, an acidic condensate is formed. Excessive buildup of sediment in the bottom of the tank can cause the bottom of the tank to overheat, boiling the water. If your showers have recently started to be ruined by unexpected blasts of cold water, then it's time to call in an expert from The Plumbing & Air Service Co. for quick solutions and trusted water heater installation and repair services you can count on.</p>
<p>One of the best advantages of an instant heating system is that you can heat up the amount of water you need and only when you need it. There is less energy wastage compared to heating a full tank of water, and reheating it again after it has cooled down. Switching to tankless from a storage tank water heater is no easy swap because it requires a plumbing retrofit and possibly an upgrade to your electric service or gas lines to increase capacity.</p>
<p>Pick the water heater that best fits your water usage, lifestyle situation, and budget. When you are not using hot water, the heater's internal sensor automatically switches off the heat exchanger. However, installation costs are lower owing the absence of a furnace. The gas hot water heater should utilize a removable anode which helps to prevent chemical reactions between the chemicals present in the tank which may cause erosion.</p>
<p>At Premier Plumbing we help you make the right decision based your needs so you know that the water heater you buy is the right one for your home or business at the lowest cost possible. Water heaters can break and leak for various reasons but some of the main problems are the water pressure is too high, a loose drain valve, wear and tear. Like any appliance, tankless water heaters will need regular maintenance and occasional troubleshooting to keep them running optimally.</p>
