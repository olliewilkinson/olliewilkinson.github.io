<h2>Water Heater Services Thomaston Georgia</h2>
<p>The water heater is one of the most important pieces of equipment that anyone has at their home. Since almost all tankless heaters are designed to maintain a desired outlet temperature, they have to restrict the flow through the heat exchanger to do so. This means that there is a limit to how much hot water they can provide at a given temperature rise or "Delta T". Basically, if you try to use more hot water at one time than the heater can provide it will limit the output volume to maintain the desired temperature.</p>
<p>Because this unit draws 27,000 Watts of electricity, you will need to upgrade your electric supply to a 240V, 200 Amp service. 10. You cannot run a short blast, or a fine trickle of water from the hot taps, as the tankless water heater will not activate under such a low demand flow. Deposits inside the heat exchanger can cause the outlets from the tankless system to become clogged. A heating element and a water storage tank are required in conventional heaters.</p>
