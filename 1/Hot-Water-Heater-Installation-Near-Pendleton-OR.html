<p>Improve your home's water and energy consumption with a tankless water heater. Endless hot water: Because tankless water heaters produce hot water on demand, your supply never runs out. Gas hot water heaters have changed over the years as now most of them have a igniter for lighting the pilot and a gas valve with built in diagnostics. Many homes have galvanized steel or plastic (CPVC) water supply pipes. As time goes on, your water heater naturally starts to fill itself with sediment at the bottom of the tank.</p>

Tankless water heaters are a higher initial cost, but they will cost less to operate because they only need to heat water as it is required and use less energy.</p>
<p>If your building inspector finds a non-direct vent heater installed in a confined space, you will probably be told to add 2 new penetrations through the wall (known as high-and-low venting) or you will be told to remove it until it conforms to the code requirements. Heating water amounts to nearly 20% of a home's energy costs, so making sure you have a reliable water heater helps you save energy and money.</p>
<p>A 50 gallon hot water tank will typically only be able to provide about 35 gallons of hot water before it runs out. If you move your gas water heater system installation to a different hot water system installation location, the gas hot water heater installation cost could be between $1000 and $2500. A tankless water heater can provide you with all of the hot water your family needs on demand, and there's no fear that you'll run out at the worst possible moment.</p>

<p>The water storage tank works in a very simple way; at the top of the tank are two feed pipes, one for cold water the other for the hot water. Whether gas or electric, tankless water heaters heat water only as it is needed and may save up to 70 percent on a yearly heating bill. The tankless water heater heats the water when it is required. These traditional heaters can be exhausted and take a long time to refill and reheat.</p>
<p>A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state: In those colder states with a more drastic rise from the temperature of the incoming water to the desired temperature, the tankless water heater is not able to produce as many GPM. So, when it comes to the selection and installation of your new water heater, you should rely on the experts America trusts for water heater services.</p>
<p>Before purchasing a tankless water heater, you will need to determine your hot water usage, which is measured in gallons per minute (GPM), and figure out your maximum hot water demand. Whether you go with an electric tankless unit or a gas one, you will save money on your utility bills. In some cases, a tankless water heater is located in a completely different location than the old water heater. If you have a tankless coil water heater, and you heat with oil, follow steps for "no heat." If you have a gas hot water tank, do not reset breaker or re-light pilot.</p>

We have been so long in this business that we have witnessed the introduction of the first tankless water heater models in Dallas. Your actual savings depend on the type, size and energy efficiency rating of the hot water system you currently own. Accelerated Damage — the extra time that a tank spends heating water can cause the metal to turn brittle, which accelerates the likelihood of crack formation.</p>

If your water heater is old and inefficient replacement might be your best option. If you have found yourself without hot water or with hot water problems, call us at Davis Home Services.
