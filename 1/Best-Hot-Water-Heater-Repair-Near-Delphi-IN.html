<h2>Water Heater Services Delphi Indiana</h2>
<p>If you've ever stepped out of a hot shower on a cold morning and were pleasantly surprised to discover a warm floor, you were probably experiencing radiant floor heating. While that might be true in some aspects, installing the gas pipes and vents needed for a gas tankless water heater may require a little bit more than your average or above average building skills. Optional in some installations, it is mandatory for a vertical wall mounted water heater in absence of load-bearing wall. If your home is regularly empty for long periods of time, switching to a tankless water heater will eliminate unnecessary water heating that takes place with tank-type models.</p>
<p>This is because the flow of energy is easier to regulate with an electric connection, plus the pilot light has to be properly ignited with a gas connection. And no tanks means no hot water sitting unused, reducing your overall heating costs by hundreds of dollars. If it's too big, you may be spending more money than necessary to heat up the water within the tank. We keep water heaters stocked at TLC so we can replace your water heater day or night.</p>
<p>Modern water heaters are also more efficient so a new water heater installation will also save you money on your energy bill. When you want help navigating the often confusing waters (no pun intended) of making the best choice of water heater for your home, you'll be pleased you contacted the professionals at Petro Home Services today. A tankless water heater in Tacoma or Seattle also ensures that you always have access to hot water because you won't have to wait for the tank to heat.</p>

<p>Although there is an increasing number of homeowners who have successfully installed a tankless water heater themselves, manufacturers strongly encourage buyers not to. First and foremost, there is the issue of safety. Take a look at your current gas heater and notice the vent hood which is slightly above the top of the heater. The longer lifetime of tankless models means homeowners incur less expense repairing and replacing the water heater.</p>
<p>They are called tankless as they heat up water only during the times you turn on your hot water tap. If your water heater is nearing the end of its useful life and you're thinking of replacing it before disaster strikes, you'll be happy to know that you have better choices, thanks to recent federal regulations that require water heaters to be more energy-efficient. Since tankless models heat water on demand, they usually end up heating a lower volume of water for less time when compared to conventional water heaters.</p>
