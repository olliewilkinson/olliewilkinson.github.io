<p>While scale can shorten the life of the heating element, you don't need to invest in fancy features to get a water heater that lasts. Tankless heaters can be installed underneath sinks or in small closets as well as in traditional hot water tank enclosures. As a result, their expected equipment life is possibly longer - more than 20 years, compared with 10 - 15 years for traditional heaters.

If you're fortunate enough to live someplace sunny most of the year around, a solar powered water heater may be an option for you. Another important factor that could impact your installation costs for your tankless or demand-type water heaters is the venting requirement.</p>
<p>Even if a larger heater is available, there is always a size and weight consideration in an RV. Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon, so even if you had room for a 20-30 gallon unit, the extra 80-200 pounds of water plus the weight of the bigger unit is usually a problem. The higher the EF number, the more efficiently the water heater uses its energy. Through increased efficiency and regular maintenance and repairs tankless water heaters can positively impact your energy bills.</p>
<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Newalla OK</h3>
<p>If the water heater is too small, it will not provide enough hot water, and it will continuously run to create more hot water, which can cause the heater to fail prematurely and increase your energy bills. In order to check or replace a water heater element you will have to turn off the breaker serving the water heater circuit and remove the access cover on the water heater. A unit that requires cleaning, maintenance, or repair will struggle to meet your hot water demands.</p>
<p>In normal conditions, the anode slowly corrodes away to protect the water heater against rust. Remember, tankless water heaters don't keep a supply of hot water ready to flow immediately when you need it. We provide a full range of repair services for tankless water heaters. It has a holding tank like a conventional water heater, but sitting atop the tank is a heat pump that captures warm air and transmits it to the water—sort of like a refrigerator working in reverse.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Gas or propane fueled tankless water heaters have better power efficient but more complex installation process. A tankless water heater system operates by using a line or pipe. Instead, heating elements are used that heat the water as it is needed. I would draw the line at trying to install a power-vented gas-fired water heater (and some other specialized models). Whether you choose gas or electric, there are many ways to get savings out of a tankless hot water heater.</p>
