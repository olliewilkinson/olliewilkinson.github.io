<p>As opposed to the more traditional way of heating water with a water tank, the wait is far less for the water to heat up and stays hotter for longer while using less energy. A family that needs frequently needs a large volume hot water (running the shower, dishwasher, and washing machine at the same time, for example), may find that a tankless water heater can't supply enough hot water to meet their needs.</p>
<p>Electric tankless models may require an upgrade of the home's electrical capacity. These units also require tankless water heater replacement less frequently than traditional units. We can service the vast majority of water heater makes and models. The gas-fired type works very much the same as the electric heater in terms of sensing water flow and instantly heating it. But in this case, a propane burner heats the water.</p>
