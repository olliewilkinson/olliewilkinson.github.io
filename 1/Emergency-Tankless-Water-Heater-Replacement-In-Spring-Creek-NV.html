<p>All homes need to have hot water, and your water heater is what makes it happen. Don't wake up every day to a long wait for hot water—or worse, an icy cold shower. If you have an electric water heater, this will mean being wired into the home's electrical grid.

Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time. Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits. You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>

<p>Please contact a professional to fix and maintain your hot water heater. Turn off the water inlet and outlet valves on the water heater. When it comes down to powering the heating process, tankless water heaters use 30-50% less electricity than water storage tank models. When you need hot water, the tankless water heater draws cold water into the heater, circulates it around a heat exchanger, and sends it back out into your home's piping.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, provide hot water only as it is needed. A tankless heater has a flow sensing device that is activated whenever a hot water tap is opened. A tankless heater only uses energy while it's heating water. Then, the temperature of your water will slowly decrease until the hot water in the tank has been completely replaced with "cold" water. These water heaters come up 98% efficient and once running will provide you with an endless stream of hot water.</p>
<p>When a hot water tap is turned on, cold water travels through a coil pipe into the unit. Homeowners with on-demand (tankless) water heaters that use less than 41 gallons or less of hot water each day, enjoy between 24 and 34 percent more energy efficiency than storage tank water heaters.

While heating a room is the most common application, it is also used to heat water, swimming pools, spas, sidewalks, driveways and garages.</p>
<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
