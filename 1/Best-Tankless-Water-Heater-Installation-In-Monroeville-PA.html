Gas is fed to the burner through a gas control valve and thermostat switch that are usually located toward the bottom of the hot water storage tank. They have trouble with hard water: Hard water is bad for any water heater, but the effects of hard water will negatively affect a tankless system quicker as the sediment builds up in its lines.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters supply hot water when you need it without the use of a storage tank. The main differences include that a direct vent heater uses an inducer motor to boost the removal of exhaust gas and can be vented with PVC pipe.

The team at Valdel Plumbing is here to provide excellence in water heater repair or installation.</p>
<p>Use channel-type pliers or a pipe wrench to loosen and disconnect the lines from the water heater. Over time, water heaters often suffer from sediment build-up that can damage the tank. For example, a sudden loss of hot water may mean that the pilot has gone out. Be sure to connect the cold water pipe to the cold water inlet on the water heater. Cold water enters the tank and is heated by an electric element or gas burner.</p>
