<h2>Water Heater Services Sugar Grove Illinois</h2>
<p>The only time most people really spend thinking about their water heaters is in the middle of winter, when they get up in the dark to take a hot shower and they're blasted with a jet of icy water. Regardless of the power source, the water stored in their tank will remain hot for several days. If there's a major problem with your water heater or it's more than 12-15 years old, it may be time to consider a new one. On average, natural gas and propane models have an installation cost of around $1,000 to $1,500. These advancements have significantly increased the number of available residential and commercial hot water heating solutions.</p>
<p>Rather than installing it in your utility room or basement, they are small enough to be installed in non-traditional spaces such as closets. Imagine this situation: Your hot water heater bursts. Whether you know exactly what type of water heater you want or you have questions about which one is right for you we are standing by. Call us today and we can help you decide which water heater is the best one for your current usage & situation.</p>

You are left with a smile and a new warranty on your professionally installed water heater. Electric tankless water heaters still save homeowners around $44 per year according to the US Department of Energy. Another reason for sticking with the more popular tankless water heater manufacturers is for the reasons of maintenance.</p>
