<h2>Water Heater Services Saint Marys Ohio</h2>
<p>Electric tankless hot water heaters come in very useful sizes - from something that looks like a loaf of bread to some the size of a PC. All have the capability of providing instant hot water on demand. Tankless water heaters are all the rage. As for the cold water side, if you have a shut off valve that is in good shape, you'll want to cut below that so that you can keep the water on to the rest of the house and if not, you'll have to shut off the water at the main and I suggest installing a new valve while you have this all opened up. These standby losses may represent 10% to 20% of a home's yearly water heating expense.</p>
<p>If you have a warranty of 12 to 15 years, which is typical, it doesn't make financial sense to replace a tank water heater with a tankless,” says Banta.

The Service Company Plumbing & Drains team is experienced in handling all types of water heater repair or replacement issues and can often have your hot water heater repaired or a new water heater installation completed same day in most cases.</p>

In order for the top element to have voltage and heat the water, the temperature of the water in the top of the tank must be lower than the temperature setting of the top thermostat.

<p>If you're using a gas-powered water heater, the burner assembly must be connected to the gas line.

We proudly offer superior water heater repair services to homeowners throughout Delaware, Southeastern Pennsylvania, Southern New Jersey, and Northeastern Maryland.</p>
