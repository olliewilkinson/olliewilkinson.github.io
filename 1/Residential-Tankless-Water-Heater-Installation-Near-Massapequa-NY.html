<p>But likewise, even though the problem may be similar, the repair solution is considerably different from a traditional tank heater. We'll consider whether you prefer gas or electric service, how much hot water your property demands, and how much available space you have for a new tank. Many a times, water heaters start with a slow leak at the base or around a corroded fitting, that is when you really need to get it checked.</p>

If this is the case then try to find the place which your pipe or tankless heater is frozen and thaw as soon as possible to prevent the pipe from bursting. The garage (free standing or attached) is one of those not-preferable locations for the water heater installation, but sometimes it is the only one.</p>
<p>Although it's a relatively simple process, it takes a professional plumber to install a tankless water heater. Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
