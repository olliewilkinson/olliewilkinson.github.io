While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>
<p>Many consumers don't realize that all tankless water systems are not the same. Also known as demand-type or instantaneous water heaters, tankless heaters provide hot water when you need it. Unlike other water heaters, this type of water heater does not lose energy while in standby mode, allowing you to save more money over the long-term.

<p>It is also a good idea to check the anode when you flush the heater, if you make this a routine you will be able to replace the anode before it is completely gone. Also, because they are not heating 40 - 50 gallons of water 24 hours a day, tankless water heaters are less susceptible to leakage than tank-type water heaters. Homeowners believing they now had cheap hot water tended to use a lot more water than before the solar heaters were installed.</p>
<p>Although still an efficient enough way to heat water, some of the problems cited with these storage tank water heaters include the heated water limits, the heating delays and maintenance problems.

Over time, even well-maintained water heaters will begin to lose efficiency and develop more problems associated with wear and tear.</p>

This is much different from a conventional water heater, which heats a large tank of water all the time so that it's still hot when you need it. They also are very well insulated to conserve the heat that the tank maintains while holding heated water.</p>
<p>Let's say you have 3 water fixtures close together and have determined that one tankless system will be purchased for serving these fixtures. Higher installation cost: The upfront cost to install a new tankless water heater is more than a conventional storage tank system. These units, which heat water with thick copper rods, are quieter and about a third smaller than gas or propane tankless heaters. Compared with a tank-type heater costing $400 or so, a $1,000 tankless gas heater may save a household only about $100 per year, depending on how efficient it is and how much hot water is used.</p>
