<h2>Water Heater Services Dandridge Tennessee</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it.

Replacement of the anode rod: To prevent water from corroding the inside of the tank, a water heater includes a sacrificial” anode rod—a long piece of metal that the water eats away at instead of the tank walls.
