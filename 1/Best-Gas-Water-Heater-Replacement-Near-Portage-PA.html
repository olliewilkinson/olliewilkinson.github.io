During the storage of the hot water in the tank, a lot of energy is wasted to keep the water at temperature even if nobody uses it for days since it needs to be heated all the time or it'll become colder by the minute, and these electricity expenses all add up quite quickly to the water bill.</p>
<p>A water heater is an item that most homeowners don't think about daily. We'll answer all your questions and provide the information you need to decide if a tankless heater fits your needs.
