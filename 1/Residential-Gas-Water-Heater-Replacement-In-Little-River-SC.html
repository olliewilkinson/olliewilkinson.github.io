Our experienced technicians are equipped and trained for electric water heater repair. When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution. Traditional water heaters work by heating and storing a set amount of water in a tank. Turning on hot water throughout the home activates the heater, even if the pilot light is not on, so you are able to check the pipes for leaks much more easily.</p>
<p>Their components are an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water until it's needed. Depending on the position of your water hookups, you may not be able to use the oversized water heater at all. Traditional water heaters come with up to a six-year warranty. These gases are blown through a coil in the base of the unit, where incoming cold water can absorb most of the heat.</p>
<p>Instead, the water is heated when it passes through the system, which may be fuelled by gas or electricity. Typical home water heaters are the large storage types that take up a significant amount of room in the garage or basement. After a while fixing a leak-prone water heater can become costly.
