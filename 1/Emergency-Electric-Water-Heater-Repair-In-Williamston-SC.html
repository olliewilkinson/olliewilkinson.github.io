<p>A small electric spark that ignites the gas usually starts the units, little cause for alarm. But it is important to note right up front that the cost of converting your current system to tankless or "demand" is more costly then substituting a conventional tank. If you want to save money, invest in professional water heater installation. Keeping your water heater in good working order is always the best first step.</p>
<p>This means hooking up water lines and, for gas units, tying in the gas line and a ventilation system to remove exhaust fumes produced by burning gas for heating. Depending on the number of people in your home and your daily hot water needs, a water heater that once provided sufficient hot water may have trouble keeping up with your current demands, especially if they have changed.

Many newer water heaters use a new electronic control valve called the Honeywell Smart Controller. Consumer Reports recently tested four electric and five gas whole-house tankless water heaters from such brands as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless to see how costs, performance, and energy use stack up against that of conventional storage tank water heaters.</p>

When you and your system are ready, we'll oversee the delivery and installation of your new tankless water heater.
