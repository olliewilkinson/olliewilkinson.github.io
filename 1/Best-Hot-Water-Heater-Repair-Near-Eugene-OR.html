<h2>Water Heater Services Eugene Oregon</h2>
<p>There are good reasons to hire a plumber for a water heater installation. Before you call the professionals, you can troubleshoot your malfunctioning hot water dispenser on your own. We take care of all your tankless water heater repair and installation services. We have provided outstanding plumbing services since 1980 and have plenty of experience with all types of water heaters. To remove the old water heater, shut off the valves on the two water lines (one inlet and one outlet) leading into the existing water heater.</p>
<p>Since a tankless unit only runs when hot water is being used, it can be left on with no waste or risk and no worries. A tankless water heater will last about twenty(20) years, while a conventional water heater may only last ten(10) to thirteen(13) years or less (depending on the quality of your water). He quickly identified the issue (lower heating element not working) and explained the situation (very old water heater) and my options to address in a very easy to understand manner.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are popular options for water heater replacements, and they're only going to become more popular as homeowners discover their numerous advantages. It could be as simple as adjusting the heat so the water gets hotter. When we manage an installation, we actually take the time to remove and drain your old unit before hauling it away. Tankless water heaters are usually powered with electricity or gas.</p>

In most cases, the savings are even more if the water heater is installed outside. It is unfortunate that not enough emphasis is placed on maintaining it on a regular basis, because your water heater is a truly vital device to modern living. Compare the cost of electricity consumed and the heating method.</p>
<p>The most cost effective way to replace a water heater is to replace like for like. That's the equivalent of taking several showers, running the dishwasher, washing one load of laundry, and turning the faucet on and off multiple times,” says John Banta, an engineer who oversees our water heater tests.

<p>Continuous Hot Water: Because a tankless water heater heats the water as it's used and doesn't rely on a full tank of hot water, you're not limited by your tank's size. If you have a gas water heater, we verify that the flue is clear prior to making the final connections. We can help you maintain your new water heater, too, so you can be sure it will last for quite some time.

<p>A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). Now that you've read up on how to drain your water heater, be sure the gas is turned off at the valve, not just at the control module. VIP Plumbing's prompt, courteous, and professional service technicians will fix all of your plumbing problems, and put your mind at ease. Because the old style had a tank full of water, every time the water in the tank drops below a certain temperature, the heating element turns on, heating the water back up, even if you aren't using it. With an inline heater, it only comes on when in use, and when you aren't using the hot water, the unit shuts off until needed again.</p>
<p>Installing a tankless hot water heater can be pricy. Fortunately, it can be easily remedied with a simple call to the experts at Valley Air Heating, Cooling & Plumbing. Identical water heaters don't always perform as well. In colder climates like ours with colder groundwater, smaller tankless water heaters will only deliver enough hot water for one shower at a time. Moreover, much of the heat produced by the pilot light of a tank-type model heats the water in the tank, heat that is just lost with the instantaneous units.</p>
<p>Lakewood Plumbing & Heating is your best choice for boiler service, repair, replacement or installation. A constant supply of lukewarm water during a shower is indicative of a defective upper heating element. The serial number contains the date that the water heater was manufactured. PSE&G customers can get a $50 coupon for water heater replacement. We specialize in hot water heater replacement, repair, and maintenance service to help you make the most of your system.</p>
<p>By the third bucket, if the water from your heater is still coming out rusty, then most likely the water heater (not the piping) is at fault. We needed a new water heater, installed the end of May. Likewise, if the existing wiring in your home cannot adequately supply electricity to your tankless water heater, there is a small chance that the wiring could short, which could potentially start an electric fire.</p>
<p>Tankless water heater works rather differently from the conventional water heating system - it does not require a tank for hot water storage and it is more environment friendly as the system avoids standby energy consumption. Meeting increased hot water demands can be a challenge for traditional tank-style heaters. No matter the type, brand, or age of your water heater, our team can repair and maintain it. Our local technicians are licensed for gas, electric, and tankless water heater repair.</p>
