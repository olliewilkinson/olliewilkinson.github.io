However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>

The main difference between electric and gas water heaters is the heat source. Once power and water supply issues are addressed, a tankless water heater is fairly straightforward to install and is certainly much easier to maneuver into place.</p>
<p>Electric tankless models may require an upgrade of the home's electrical capacity. These units also require tankless water heater replacement less frequently than traditional units. We can service the vast majority of water heater makes and models. The gas-fired type works very much the same as the electric heater in terms of sensing water flow and instantly heating it.
