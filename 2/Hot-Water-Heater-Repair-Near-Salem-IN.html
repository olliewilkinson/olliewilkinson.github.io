Turn off the power to the water heater in the service panel. From our experience in both commercial water heater repair and those of private homes, we have identified various reasons leading to regular repairs and fixed them for our clients. By installing a unit that's similar to a standard tank water heater, you can experience hot water right when you need it for as long as you need it.</p>

Turn off the gas going to the water heater at the valve that connects to the front of the water heater.

Since tankless models heat water on demand, they usually end up heating a lower volume of water for less time when compared to conventional water heaters.</p>
<p>Cold climate tankless water heaters may require extra labor to install. Energy isn't wasted heating water that can sit in a tank for hours or days. The tank water heater has been the primary mode of heating water for decades now and this method of water heating has gone unchallenged, until now. One of the biggest risks with tank-style heaters is, over time, minerals from hard water build-up within the tank which leads to corrosion and eventually leaks.</p>
