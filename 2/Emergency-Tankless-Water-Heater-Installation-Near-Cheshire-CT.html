<h2>Water Heater Services Cheshire Connecticut</h2>
<p>The water heater is an immensely important fixture in your house. You can try raising the temperature on the water heater, as discussed directly above. Once the water in the top part of the tank has reached the temperature value determined by the top thermostat setting, the top thermostat (is considered "satisfied") switches power from the top element to the lower thermostat. We can help guide you through these and help you choose the hot water heater that will best match your needs for hot water output while maximizing the efficiency of the utility source from which it runs.</p>
<p>If a water heater is installed without a T&P valve (temperature and pressure relief valve) it may explode.

Your Blind & Sons plumber will perform a capacity test to determine the right size water heater for your home.</p>
