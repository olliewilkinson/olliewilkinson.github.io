Or, finally, you find your hot water heater closet's an impenetrable jungle of soldered copper, unions, flex connectors, and thermoplastic - all improvised by your adorable "handyman" over the years - call a HVAC contractor.</p>
<p>During the course of an average home occupancy, a resident is bound to face that moment where they need to replace a water heater. Traditional tank water heaters can become rusted or corroded over time. They constantly heat water so hot water is consistently prepared.

<p>This may be an old resistive type heater and should be replaced by more modern heaters that can be up to 5 times more efficient at heating water. Savings: Unlike traditional water heaters, tankless units only heat water as it is needed, which results in extra energy savings per month. Although gas tankless water heaters are clearly more efficient than their storage tank cousins, their efficiency normally tops out at 80-85%.</p>
<p>If you live in a multi-person household, compare tankless models, paying particular attention to the gallons per minute (GPM) flow of each model. Even when there is no demand, the water must be reheated every time the temperature falls below the thermostat threshold. When the stored water cools due to standby heat loss, a thermostat in the tank triggers the reheating process. And because the heat pump is on top, a hybrid water heater needs as much as 7 feet of clearance from floor to ceiling.</p>

<p>Thank you AC Plumbing Heating & Air for squeezing me in on a short notice to get my AC serviced. With a conventional water heater you are limited by the amount of hot water it holds.

This can save you, on average, over $80 in hot water costs each year.</p>
