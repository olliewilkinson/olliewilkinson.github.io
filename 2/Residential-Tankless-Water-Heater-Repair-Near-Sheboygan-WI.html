While it's usually recommended to stick with a gas water heater if you're concerned about energy costs, it is possible to switch from a gas to an electric water heater in Las Vegas. We have a comprehensive selection of gas and electric tank water heaters offered in multiple sizes, all with excellent warranties and installation.

When it comes to your water heater, Radiant plumbers are equipped to perform maintenance, repairs, replacements, and also hot water heater installations.

<p>Energy Savings: Because these units only heat water when it's needed, you can save big on energy costs. Water heaters are essentially steel tanks with vitreous glass bonded to the inside to protect the steel from rust. Retrofitting a home with a tankless unit can be a complicated process as compared to traditional storage tank and may cost as high as $3,000. Gas water heater: Turn off the gas supply at the shutoff valve on the gas pipe nearest the water heater.</p>
<p>If the valve didn't work, then the water heater needs to be replaced. Step 3. Turn off the water to the water heater or if the valve is not working turn off the water to the house.

If our water heater inspection determines that your unit has outlived its useful life or is damaged beyond economical repair, we may suggest a full water heater replacement.</p>
<p>Storage water heaters lose heat and can cost a lot of money in maintenance over time. The main advantage of tankless water heaters is that they are energy efficient and save you money over the long term. A main unit could be repositioned to shorten the run to some of the most used outlets while a smaller electric on-demand heater could be use to supplement in a bedroom or utility room. Plus, many tankless units, even those that run on gas, require an electrical connection to operate, which may require an additional supply line to be installed.</p>

Energy Efficiency: As water heaters age, they become less energy efficient, using more gas or electricity to generate less hot water.</p>
