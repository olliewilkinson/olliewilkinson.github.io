<p>But because these tankless gas units last longer, the savings kicks in after six years, about when many tanks are nearing their demise. Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger delivering it directly to your faucets or shower without using a storage tank. Whether you're in central Austin, or a surrounding city such as Lakeway, Bee Caves, Round Rock, Westlake Hills or Georgetown, TX, there is always potential for your water heater to experience one of these issues.</p>
