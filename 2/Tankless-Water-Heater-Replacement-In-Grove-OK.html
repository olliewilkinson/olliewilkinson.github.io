The higher the EF number, the more efficiently the water heater uses its energy.

You don't have to worry about a water heater that is constantly heating up water, because the tankless water heater will only heat up the water that you need since it provides on-demand hot water. Although tankless water heaters are also called "instantaneous water heaters," they still take time to heat water, so after the trapped water was used up, you were left with a gap of unheated water.</p>

<p>While traditional water heaters will typically have a lifespan of anywhere between ten and fifteen years, most tankless units can be expected to be in use for over twenty years. The tank is heavy, so you will probably want to have some very strong rope so that you can lower the old water heater down and raise the new one up. Our tankless water heater maintenance plans can make this easier, more convenient and less expensive to do while offering you priority service as a maintenance plan member.</p>
<p>When you need a new tankless water heater installed, your first task should be to select a reliable plumbing company who will provide you with free written price quotes, a history of reliability and integrity, a connection to your community, and a dedication to customer service and satisfaction. The peak hour demand or first-hour rating (FHR) is the measure of how much hot water the heater will deliver in an hour, and the FHR is required by law to appear on the Energy Guide label.</p>
<p>Some heater models come with an incorporated technology using which the water flow generates a pilot spark. This means that you will need a tankless heater for every water source.
