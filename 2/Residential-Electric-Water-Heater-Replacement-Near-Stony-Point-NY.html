<h2>Water Heater Services Stony Point New York</h2>
<p>Paloma tankless hot water heaters are among the popular choices out there. On the other hand, tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, do not rely on preheated water. Turn off the power to the water heater in the service panel.

The water passes through a heat exchanger, where heat from either natural gas or electrical heating elements is applied to it.

Leak repair: If you notice water anywhere near the unit, call a plumber right away.</p>
<p>Many consumers don't realize that all tankless water systems are not the same. Also known as demand-type or instantaneous water heaters, tankless heaters provide hot water when you need it.
