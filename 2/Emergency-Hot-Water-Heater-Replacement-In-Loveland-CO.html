<p>These are not required for gas instant hot water systems. Electric water heaters are high-voltage (240-volt) appliances that are dangerous to work with when the power is on. Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box). Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>
<p>The maintenance necessary for your water heater depends on location, design of the unit, quality of installation, water quality, and manufacturer recommendations. You usually notice a leak when there is a puddle around the bottom of the water heater or they may be a trail leading back to the tank. Note: Unless the water heater stopped working more than a few hours ago, the water spilling out will be hot. Instead of storing heated water in tank, it supplies water only when needed.</p>

Water leaks usually are caused by leaking valves and plumbing connections, but they can also be related to tank problems. This model of heater can serve a practically unlimited source of hot water, because it's constantly heating a big amount of water.</p>
<p>It will also take a long time for the water you need to heat up, since it only starts to do so when you turn on a tap. While the water heater is filling up leave the faucets on so you can bleed all of the air out of the system. The main companies producing such heaters are Bosch, Rheum and Noritz.
