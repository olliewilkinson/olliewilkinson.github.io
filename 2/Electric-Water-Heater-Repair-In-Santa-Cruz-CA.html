<h2>Water Heater Services Santa Cruz California</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Your hot water heater controls the water temperature of your home or business. In a gas powered setup the components include an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, a gas control valve and a thermocouple. Luckily we at Lascko Services have the expertise needed to provide you with the very best water heater service around. A water heater replacement in most cases can be installed and working perfectly within a just a few hours as well, excluding unexpected complications.</p>
<p>Whether you repair or replace, water heaters will perform better and last longer if you flush the tank once a year to remove sediment. If you are not 100% confident installing an electric water heater, Lowe's recommends that you hire a professional. Gas units are often a little higher costs for installation because of the venting required. If the water starts out in the middle of the heater for instance, it will leave the heater after only being in the pipe for half the time it would need to reach full temperature.</p>

<p>However, they can reduce energy consumption by as much as 30 percent, by only heating water when it is needed rather than keeping a tank of hot water constantly heated. This is known as standby energy loss and it's costing you money.
