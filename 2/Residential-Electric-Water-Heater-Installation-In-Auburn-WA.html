<h2>Water Heater Services Auburn Washington</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>Water heater failure can happen anytime and may lead to your tank fully discharging, potential damage and temporary loss of service. Specialists from Downey Plumbing Heating & Air Conditioning will help you reach your goals when it comes to water heating systems. The tankless water heaters also cause an increase in water wastage since you have to let the water run longer to get your hot water. Before finalizing everything, make sure that you do enough comparison with the existing heaters that are out in the market.</p>
<p>Solar water heaters use a storage tank that keeps water heated by the sun. For thread-in-type elements like we show here, you'll need a water heater element wrench ($5 at home centers and hardware stores). Tankless water heaters are different in their rating system—they are sold according to the demand they can meet, the flow rate, and are measured in gallons per minute (GPM). If you're running out of hot water too quickly, there are a couple things to check.</p>
<h3>Local Tankless Water Heater Repair Auburn</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters are still unusual in the U.S., where tank-type water heaters have been used for many years. Although a second unit might seem like a large investment, it can actually save you money in the long run since you'll use less water while waiting for hot water to arrive and less gas to heat the water. A tankless gas water heater needs a gas line to the water heater, and the unit must be vented to the outside.</p>
<p>While scale can shorten the life of the heating element, you don't need to invest in fancy features to get a water heater that lasts. Tankless heaters can be installed underneath sinks or in small closets as well as in traditional hot water tank enclosures. As a result, their expected equipment life is possibly longer - more than 20 years, compared with 10 - 15 years for traditional heaters. We have a range of gas and electric tank water heaters offered in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are compact heating units that provide hot water as it is needed and do not store hot water like traditional tank-type water heaters. Tankless hot water heaters are ideal for new homes and major renovations. The storage tank holds the heated water for household usage. A Tankless water heater is typically wall-mounted, requires less space, and is much higher in efficiency than standard types.</p>
<p>The average cost for a plumber to install a water heater is about $80 per hour. If the sacrificial anode rod is not replaced once it has been fully corroded, your hot water storage tank will begin to corrode, meaning you will probably have to replace it prematurely. One or both heating elements may have burned out and need replacing. When purchased from a Rinnai® authorized dealer and installed by a licensed installation professional, your Rinnai® tankless water heater comes with a generous warranty to give you even more peace of mind.</p>

<p>The worst traditional electric heaters are 93 percent efficient. Maybe your hot water heater has sprung a leak or it's just stopped working. If your home uses less than 42 gallons of hot water daily, a tankless water heater can operate up to 34 percent more efficiently than a storage tank water heater. Upper thermostat may have failed and requires replacement or heating element may have failed and requires replacement.</p>
<p>If the heating elements are good, the problem could be with the thermostats or cutoff switch. A traditional hot water heater typically holds 40-60 gallons of water that is collected in a tank and then continuously heated until it's needed. For your convenience we even offer extended warranty coverage on parts and labor on all water heaters installed by All Seasons Comfort Control. We can review the benefits of a storage tank vs. a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>You may also need to wire in the new water heater unless you're lucky enough to have a properly sized power source nearby. After completing all the connections, the final step is to connect the new water heater to the power supply. Our tankless Installation price includes the job from start to finish along with the removal of old equipment and materials. Next if your heater came with a T&P valve unbox it and pipe dope those threads.</p>
<p>Installation: Tankless water heaters are smaller, so they require less space in your home. Tankless units can be placed at a convenient place when possible.

<p>Depending on the service load of your home, you may need an electrician to install a larger breaker to provide you with enough power. Most tank-style water heaters won't live past 20 years. Press the probe tips against the terminals of the heating element (one probe to each screw). Energy efficiency of your water heater can be improved through its correct installation and maintenance. A bonus: Without all that gunk inside, your water heater will operate more efficiently, saving you money.</p>
