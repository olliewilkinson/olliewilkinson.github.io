As opposed to waiting for a storage tank to fill with enough hot water for use, tankless water heaters provide a constant supply of it. If you're looking for an energy-efficient option to supply your home with hot water, tankless water heaters are worth serious consideration.

<p>Who should buy a tank water heater: If you have a timeline or budget constraints that prevent you from getting a tankless system, a tank heater may be the way to go. If your home runs strictly on electricity, you have to carefully consider whether going tankless is really worth it. The average household capacity is around 200 amps, which may not be enough to support a tankless electric heater. Tankless hot water heaters are available in propane (LP), natural gas, or electric models.</p>

<p>Double check the voltage on the circuit in the home's electrical panel and at the point it connects to the heater - most are 240 volts. You can expect to pay much less for your hot water when you use a tankless system. This is due to the fact that hot water tanks store water that can experience what is called "standby" losses, when heat evaporates through the flue or sides of the tank. As your water heater is used day in and day out, expect to have to perform some amount of repair.</p>
<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
