<h2>Water Heater Services Gastonia North Carolina</h2>
<p>Many consumers are choosing to upgrade their current tank water heater to the new and improved tankless water heater systems that are available. We provide everything from hot water tank replacement to water heater maintenance. I called and the very next day they came out and repaired my heating service and did an excellent job. As mentioned, installing a new water heater of any type requires expertise in electrical, gas, and plumbing. Colder incoming groundwater temperature will limit the product options to the higher kW units, which require a larger electrical service and breaker size capacity.</p>
<p>Age- Most water heaters last roughly 10 - 15 years. A plumbing inspector will come to your place and look at the installation to make sure that the work was done properly. Rust: Anytime there's rust on the outside of your tank, around fittings, or in the water itself, you're water heater may be on its last legs. Solar power water heater systems use the sun's energy to generate warm water for your home. The compact designs of this kind of heater leaves space for a water softener or additional storage such as "use it as you need it".</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing. If the water is still as hot as it was before you turned the temperature down, it's because the thermostat isn't working. That's why it's important to regularly maintain and, if necessary, repair your hot water tank — and that's a task that AirPlus Heating & Cooling can assist you with. It is important to know what you have as well as the benefits and disadvantages to making water heater changes, which is why our friendly technicians are here to help.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Gastonia North Carolina 28054</h3>
<p>Press the red probe against either terminal screw of the heating element. Call us today to set up your tankless water heater installation, maintenance or repair. Hot water system installation cost depends on the distance from the existing hot water system installation and the electrical work required. Alternatively, odd noises coming from the water heater itself could point to sediment being burned by the heating element in the tank, or the heating element itself.</p>
<p>You can also use a tankless hot water system which effectively only heats the water that you need when you need it. This certifies that the water is not always heated multiple times inside the big tank. These layers make the tank use more energy to heat up, causing the unit to overheat and weaken. When this happens, the pressure inside your water heater will build up and an explosion will occur. According to Home Depot, the chart below can help you determine how big of a tank water heater you need for your household.</p>
<p>If you have an older water heater, there are many reasons for you to consider upgrading to a new one, including better energy efficiency, better performance, and less risk of a breakdown.
