<p>How much will a new hot water heater cost you? The designs have one principle heat source shared between two other pieces of equipment, a tank water heater and an air handler and these make up a space heating water heater system. Flow rate is the amount of water that a tankless unit can heat at a given time. It wastes energy by holding the temperature of water that is not currently in use.

Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>
<p>Many consumers don't realize that all tankless water systems are not the same. Also known as demand-type or instantaneous water heaters, tankless heaters provide hot water when you need it.
