<h2>Water Heater Services Oak Grove Kentucky</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank.

<p>The new Federal Water Heater Energy Standards have produced a burst of energy in new water heater design and technology Here's a cool Infographic from the U.S. Department of Energy.

<p>Turn off the water and gas or electric before you begin, and take particular care to vent gas models properly. Use 2 T joints to divide the hot and cold water inlets, so as to fit the water heater onto one side and the shower, sink, bath or washbasin on the other side. With an electric hot water heater, several other components could be causing you to lose hot water. Solar water heaters work using roof-mounted solar panels that absorb the sun's heat and transfer it to an antifreeze-like fluid in a closed-loop system that runs to the water tank and heats the water.</p>

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
<p>For over 30 years, we've been the go-to water heater installation company in the area, and we strive to maintain our excellent reputation. This is because the hot water sitting in the pipes will eventually cool down if you don't use it.

<p>It may solve the problem, but if the problem recurs, check your heating elements. The unit shuts down when the hot water tap is turned off.
