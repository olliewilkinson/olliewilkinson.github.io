<h2>Water Heater Services Paso Robles California</h2>
<p>I over heard a couple at a home improvement store asking a clerk why their 125 gal hot water tank wasn't doing the job. It keeps the water at the required heated level while the heater is turned on. It should be noted that, in this example, we generously gave the storage water heaters a 15 year lifetime. There are many reasons why you should hire a plumber for water heater installation. If you need water heater repair, you need Aire Serv. The main advantage of tankless models is that they only heat the water when you need it, so they don't waste energy keeping the water warm around the clock.</p>
<p>Tankless units have an average lifespan about twice that of conventional water heaters — 20 years or more. Call us today to schedule service for your water heater. One very good way of increasing the efficiency of your gas heater is by adding an insulation jacket. For all water heaters, life expectancy will depend on local variables such as water chemistry and homeowner maintenance.” For the purpose of this example, we'll assume both the tankless water heater and the storage water heater will each last 15 years.</p>
<p>If you live in a warm or temperate climate, where the groundwater temperature is always above 55 degrees Fahrenheit, you will be able to run one main hot water fixture (a shower, bath, dishwasher, washing machine or kitchen sink), and a bathroom sink at the same time. While this is not something that people are too happy about, it is so important to get a replacement for your water heater when it is needed.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Paso Robles</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters are more energy and space efficient, have a longer lifespan and perform better than conventional water heaters, but most homes are still equipped with conventional heaters, whose average life span is ten to fifteen years. Tankless water heaters offer a proven alternative to the storage tank water heaters most commonly found in US homes. The job of the temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve is to release excessive pressure from steam buildup, but the TP valve may have been improperly installed, or it may be faulty.</p>

<p>Low Capacity: The water heater that was originally installed in your home was not designed to keep up with a growing family and modern appliances. Many newer water heaters use a new electronic control valve called the Honeywell Smart Controller. Consumer Reports recently tested four electric and five gas whole-house tankless water heaters from such brands as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless to see how costs, performance, and energy use stack up against that of conventional storage tank water heaters.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can now compare prices online for all the major brands of gas hot water systems prices including Rinnai hot water system price, Bosch hot water, Rheem hot water systems prices, Dux hot water system prices and AquaMAX hot water. According to the website, tankless heaters can provide between 2-5 gallons per minute, with gas-powered units producing the higher GPM. You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperatures and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
