<h2>Water Heater Services Lacombe Louisiana</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>We've been working in and around the Laguna Hills and Mission Viejo area for over 20 years, and in that time have refined our services to become the best. If however, the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is lower than the setting of the lower thermostat, the lower thermostat switches "on" and sends voltage to the lower heating element (a thermostat that has switched power to a heating element or cooling compressor is said to be "calling") and heats the water.</p>
<p>Attach the vent pipe to the draft hood on the water heater (for gas water heaters only). A properly sized unit with sufficient air and gas inputs will provide efficient, on-demand hot water for your customers, leading to increased comfort and long-term savings. Now it's time to establish the cold (usually right side) and hot (usually left side) water connections. On a chilly day, it can take several minutes for hot water to travel from the hot water heater tank to your shower.</p>
