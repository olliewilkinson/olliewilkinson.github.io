<h2>Water Heater Services Albuquerque New Mexico</h2>
<p>One of the most common investments a homeowner finds themselves required to make in a home is a new water heater. Many people are now going to tankless or on-demand hot water heaters simply because they are more energy efficient and use water only as it is needed.

Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time. Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits.
