<h2>Water Heater Services Portland Connecticut</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>Tank water heaters are the most common kind of water heater. After that, the new water heater can be brought in and maneuvered into place. When setting up a space heating water heating system you need a higher output quick recovery unit for some systems, like an electric forced hot air handler serviced by a hydronic heating coil. In the end, it is putting more pressure on the water heater to work. Our maintenance free heating units help water temperatures stay at safe levels.</p>
