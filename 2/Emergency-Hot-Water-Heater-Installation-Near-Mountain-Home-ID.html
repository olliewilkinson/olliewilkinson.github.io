<p>Older water heaters that use a tank can be quite large and take up a lot of space. The colder the incoming water the more heat the heater has to create. This can put a lot of strain on an average system, in such cases it could be wise to install more than one heater. The breakdown of your hot water heater can be from both preventable and unpreventable causes, such as a buildup of mineral scale, a disconnected gas or power supply, a problem with the temperature pressure release valve, and vent obstructions.</p>
