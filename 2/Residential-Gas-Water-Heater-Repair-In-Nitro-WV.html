<h2>Water Heater Services Nitro West Virginia</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>3. If you are not getting the same hot water as you used to, then you probably need a new heater or to at least have it checked. Like our other services, your new water heater will be backed by our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee for a year. There are several key operational differences between tankless and conventional heaters. When you're enjoying quality family time, the last thing you need is a plumbing emergency.</p>

We've taken a closer look at the best tank versus tankless heaters so you can narrow your search and find the perfect water heater for your home and lifestyle. Periodic water heater maintenance can significantly extend your water heater's life and minimize loss of efficiency. Water heaters are heavy. The fuel used by a water heating system will not only affect annual operation costs but also the water heater's size and energy efficiency.</p>

<p>This may be an old resistive type heater and should be replaced by more modern heaters that can be up to 5 times more efficient at heating water. Savings: Unlike traditional water heaters, tankless units only heat water as it is needed, which results in extra energy savings per month. Although gas tankless water heaters are clearly more efficient than their storage tank cousins, their efficiency normally tops out at 80-85%.</p>
<p>Because hot water is essential to our everyday lives, it is important to manage and maintain your hot water heater. Tankless heaters do not have a large standing water supply, instead they instantly heat the water to the necessary temperature as it is required. Hybrid electric heat pump water heaters don't work well in very cold spaces. We will send out an experienced hot water heater contractor to resolve your water heating issues and to help your home continue operating like it was meant to.</p>

<h3>Most Typical Plumbing Services Nitro WV</h3>
<p>This guide outlines a typical gas tankless water heater installation with easily available tools and materials. Such resources sometimes answer scientific questions such as energy use, capacity, costs and savings. Whether you need a simple repair , maintenance service, or a full system replacement, even including tankless water heater installations, we have the training and experience you can rely on. Even without rebates or tax credits, reduced operating costs often pay for appliance replacement over the time period the appliance is expected to last.</p>
<p>Water heaters that are not installed correctly can leak, causing water and mold damage. If water does take a long time to get to a faucet, the real solution is to add a circulation system to your water's heat source. However, if you're in the market for a water heater upgrade or new installation, you may want to consider tankless water heaters. All hot water system installation must be done by a licensed plumber in accordance with hot water system installation regulations.</p>
