<h2>Water Heater Services Mauldin South Carolina</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>The tankless hot water heater will heat the water as it goes through the heat exchanger, which is activated by the incoming water as it flows through.

Your perfect water heater will differ depending on your hot water expectations, your budget, and the layout of your home.</p>

Endless hot water, additional storage space and lower energy bills are just a few reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters. Tankless water heaters also take up much less space and can be installed virtually anywhere in your home.</p>

They both use an insulated storage tank jacket made of steel, with insulation between the storage tank and the tank jacket to reduce heat loss of the heated water.</p>

Then your hot water tank is suddenly on the forefront of your mind. At Heil Plumbing, we constantly update our products to give homeowners and builders efficient water heater systems.</p>
