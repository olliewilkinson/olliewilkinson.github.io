<h2>Water Heater Services Caribou Maine</h2>
<p>When it comes to water heaters, there is strong disagreement as to which one type of electric hot water heater is better: whether gas hot water heater or the electric hot water heater. Furthermore, some types of water heater damage cannot be repaired and always require system replacement, regardless of the age of your water heater. Installation for these gas pipes require professionals who know the risks and safety measures needed to ensure that there are no leakages that can cause fires and accidents. This hybrid system makes use of your current plumbing and is a great choice for restaurants or other locations where there is a high demand for hot water.</p>
<p>High-Efficiency Products: We carry some of the most efficient products on the market, and our high-efficiency water heaters help save money on your utilities. With a storage water heater, you have to wait at least 10 minutes between each shower for the hot water supply to replenish. There are fewer moving parts in a space heating water heater and this means easy maintenance and fewer services. When the heater needs to serve several fixtures, you still need to select a location that reduces the total length of hot water piping.</p>
<p>Due to their small size, tankless hot water heaters can be installed on most flush wall surfaces, as long as they have access to fuel and water lines (which should already be taken care of). A point-of-use (POU) electric tankless water heater should not be a problem in terms of amperage requirements.

A conventional water heater (tank) can last up to 15 years with proper maintenance. Most gas-powered tankless water heaters do qualify for a $300 federal tax rebate. Water heaters need space to operate safely and an improperly installed unit can be a constant source of danger in your home.</p>
<p>Because tankless water heaters draw water from your main water line only as you need it, there is no possibility of flooding from this kind of system. The only higher percentage is heating and cooling costs. One of the lesser-known downsides of tankless water heaters is that they have difficulty achieving a lukewarm water temperature. For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time might stretch a tankless water heater to its limit.</p>
<p>The type of tankless water heater chosen for any given application will depend on incoming water temperatures and building use patterns. And if you need your existing system serviced or repaired, our professional, factory-trained technicians will identify the issues and make repairs.

Like our other services, your new water heater will be covered by our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee for a year. This heat from the pilot flame causes a tiny electrical signal to be sent to the control valve, telling the control valve that there is a flame present so it's OK to let the gas through to the main burner when the thermostat calls for heat.</p>
