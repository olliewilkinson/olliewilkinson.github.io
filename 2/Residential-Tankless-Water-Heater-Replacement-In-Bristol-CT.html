<h2>Water Heater Services Bristol Connecticut</h2>
<p>The only time most people really spend thinking about their water heaters is in the middle of winter, when they get up in the dark to take a hot shower and they're blasted with a jet of icy water. Regardless of the power source, the water stored in their tank will remain hot for several days. If there's a major problem with your water heater or it's more than 12-15 years old, it may be time to consider a new one. On average, natural gas and propane models have an installation cost of around $1,000 to $1,500.

<p>Hot water is hot water but it does make a difference in the ultimate price you pay in energy bills which type of hot water heater you choose.

Circuit wiring is usually housed in flexible metal cable or conduit where it connects to the water heater.

Using a natural gas rate of $10.86 per 1,000 cubic feet, we calculated that the payback time for converting from a storage tank gas water heater to a gas tankless ranges from 22½ years to 27½ years.</p>
