<p>How much will a new hot water heater cost you? The designs have one principle heat source shared between two other pieces of equipment, a tank water heater and an air handler and these make up a space heating water heater system. Flow rate is the amount of water that a tankless unit can heat at a given time. It wastes energy by holding the temperature of water that is not currently in use.

Similar to gas-fired tank-type systems, gas-fired tankless systems include a vent that removes any by-products created during the combustion process.
