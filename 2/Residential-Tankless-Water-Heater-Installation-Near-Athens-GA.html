<h2>Water Heater Services Athens Georgia</h2>
<p>Thermal couple repair is probably the most common repair on a gas fired water heater. Most, if not all codes require that gas burning equipment be installed where they have enough air to "breathe". The type of fuel required will affect not only the operating costs but also the purchase price of your tankless water heater. If you currently have a water heater that's in fine condition but you are looking to upgrade to a new one, the plumbers at All About Plumbing & Septic are able to help you.</p>
<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>
<p>If you decide to go this route, Ronk Brothers Heating and Cooling offer all the services you need to keep your tankless water heater running. This type of water heater is also known as a demand” heater because the heating element only comes on when a demand is made for hot water. When you are experiencing problems with your water heater, you will want to make sure the issue is quickly resolved to limit the disruption to your day and reduce any potential damage from the problem.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Athens</h3>
<p>I lost hot water and heat at 10pm. Additionally, because they're not holding water all day every day, instant water heaters are also known to last longer, making them one of the smartest upgrades you can make in your home. If it moves through the panels, the liquid will be heated and then the heat transferred to the water in the tank. If you have a big family that uses lots of hot water regularly then we have a big capacity energy-efficient unit that can service both showers and the dishwasher all at the same time.</p>

While maintenance on water heaters is fairly simple, we still recommend you have a professional handle it to make sure everything is functioning as it should.

<p>If you notice any of the symptoms above, your water heater system likely requires repair or replacement. As mentioned above, tankless water heaters are smaller than traditional tank heaters. If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, produce hot water only when you want it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when added to homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water each day, according to They also last about two times as long as a tank water heater. Most RV water heaters have either 6 gallon or 10 gallon tanks. If you have a tankless water heater, you will never find yourself in that scenario.</p>
<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Athens GA</h3>
<p>In the world of tankless electric water heaters, Joe from New York is going to need more power to achieve the same temperature of hot water as Jane from Florida. It is a direct route to the exterior from the heater and works on the "hot air rises" principle which means that the hot combustion gases from the heater rise up, get captured by the draft hood and are lead to the exterior. The employees are excellent to work with: sales, repair, installation, follow-up.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters have been growing in popularity lately, especially with the new water heater energy efficiency regulations. A gas water heater typically will have an EF between 0.50 and 0.80, with electric heaters around 0.90. A higher EF means more energy-efficiency and likely lower operating costs. Hot water system installation cost depends on your plumber. ClimateCare members are trained to repair every make and model of water heater, and update their training when new technologies enter the market.</p>
<p>All new water heaters should have an anode rod installed from the factory. Well, without a quality hot water heater that luxury can become unreliable at best and unavailable at worst.

Such advice has saved many of them the cost of repairs, common accidents, loss of business revenue and energy consumption.

<p>Double check the voltage on the circuit in the home's electrical panel and at the point it connects to the heater - most are 240 volts. You can expect to pay much less for your hot water when you use a tankless system. This is due to the fact that hot water tanks store water that can experience what is called "standby" losses, when heat evaporates through the flue or sides of the tank. As your water heater is used day in and day out, expect to have to perform some amount of repair.</p>

<p>Electric units face even bigger changes. A tankless heater is not effective when more than two tasks are drawing from it. So it should be one at a time.
