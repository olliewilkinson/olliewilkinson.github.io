They may require a mechanical permit, gas piping permit and electrical permit depending on the local jurisdiction and what was required to install the new appliance.</p>

<p>To minimize the cost of hot water, reduce the temperature of your hot water heater from the standard 140 degrees F to 120 degrees F.
