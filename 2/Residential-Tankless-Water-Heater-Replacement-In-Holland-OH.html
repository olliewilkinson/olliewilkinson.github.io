When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution. Traditional water heaters work by heating and storing a set amount of water in a tank. Turning on hot water throughout the home activates the heater, even if the pilot light is not on, so you are able to check the pipes for leaks much more easily.</p>
