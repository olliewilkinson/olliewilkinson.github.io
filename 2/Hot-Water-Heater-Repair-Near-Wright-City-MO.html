<h2>Water Heater Services Wright City Missouri</h2>
<p>Water Heaters are a necessary household appliance that supplies all of your warm water needs, from cooking to bathing. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more often. We also want enough hot water for our needs and energy costs savings. Many people don't know much about water heaters or water heater repairs. A well-maintained tankless water heater can last for a long time. Typical anticipated lifetimes for these water heaters are 8-12 years for conventional and 10-15 years for high-efficiency.</p>
<p>Replaced 40 gallon electric water heater and thermal expansion tank. We will make sure you get the best water heater solution for your needs, we will handle all aspects of the installation, and we will remove your old water heater. We can provide regular maintenance, repairs, and replacements to help increase the life of your water heater. Especially if you choose a model with a large tank, your energy bills can really add up over time.</p>
<p>Modern water heaters are also more efficient so a new water heater installation will also save you money on your energy bill. When you want help navigating the often confusing waters (no pun intended) of making the best choice of water heater for your home, you'll be pleased you contacted the professionals at Petro Home Services today. A tankless water heater in Tacoma or Seattle also ensures that you always have access to hot water because you won't have to wait for the tank to heat.</p>
<h3>Affordable Tankless Water Heater Installation Wright City</h3>
<p>Depending on your location and other components, you have a variety of options for powering your new water heater. A common misconception is that a water heater which has stopped functioning has to be replaced. With these units, you don't have to ever worry about a rusted tank that leaks. The power source for a tankless water heater needs to be readily accessible in the area where the tank is installed. Many people choose to simply use the same type that they are using presently, while others are influenced by the purchase price, the cost of running the heater over time, how energy efficient they are and how long it takes for the water to heat.</p>
<p>Although there is an increasing number of homeowners who have successfully installed a tankless water heater themselves, manufacturers strongly encourage buyers not to. First and foremost, there is the issue of safety. Take a look at your current gas heater and notice the vent hood which is slightly above the top of the heater. The longer lifetime of tankless models means homeowners incur less expense repairing and replacing the water heater.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are energy efficient compared to traditional water heating systems, as they do not work until a hot water faucet is turned on. Regular maintenance can keep your tankless unit going up to 20 years — twice as long as standard storage water heaters. That's because of their reputation for running more efficiently, an appealing characteristic given that heating water is the average U.S. home's second highest utility cost after heating and cooling the house itself.</p>
<p>We were also rather lean with our 15 year estimated lifetime for the whole-home tankless gas water heater, which is suggested to last longer than 20 years and in fact carries a longer warranty then the gas storage water heaters. Installing our water heater is really as easy as reversing everything we just did. From repairs, installations, and upgrades, our technicians are known for getting the job done right every time.</p>
<h3>Necessary Services That A Good Plumbing Service Can Provide Wright City MO</h3>

You should always buy a new tankless water heater system to prevent issues and concerns from coming up. Tankless water heaters may be that solution. Professional installation of your tankless system is absolutely essential. Befor you replace your current water heater, learn four common myths associated with tankless units.</p>
<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>Compare this to a setup in a home with a small water heater where, potentially, the second or third person wanting to take a shower might have to wait for 20-30 minutes for the water heater to heat enough water. The main difference between electric and gas water heaters is the heat source. Once power and water supply issues are addressed, a tankless water heater is fairly straightforward to install and is certainly much easier to maneuver into place.</p>
<p>If you are ready to replace your existing water heater or install a new type of water heater system, our plumbers can help. Whirlpool water heaters are available at Lowe's. My first water heater was 20 years old & I only changed it because neighbors were having problems & was kind of ignorant. Then the water is returned to the hot water storage tank, ready for use in the kitchen, bath or laundry room. Always shut off the power to an electric water heater before working on it. And never work on it if water is pooled on the floor near the appliance.</p>
