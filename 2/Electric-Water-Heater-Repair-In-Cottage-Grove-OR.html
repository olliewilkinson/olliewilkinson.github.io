<h2>Water Heater Services Cottage Grove Oregon</h2>
<p>If you've ever stepped out of a hot shower on a cold morning and were pleasantly surprised to discover a warm floor, you were probably experiencing radiant floor heating. While that might be true in some aspects, installing the gas pipes and vents needed for a gas tankless water heater may require a little bit more than your average or above average building skills. Optional in some installations, it is mandatory for a vertical wall mounted water heater in absence of load-bearing wall. If your home is regularly empty for long periods of time, switching to a tankless water heater will eliminate unnecessary water heating that takes place with tank-type models.</p>
<p>Fortunately, since tankless heaters do not have a tank, there is absolutely zero risk of an explosion ever occurring. Sometimes the hot water tank in the system is the only one used to provide the home with hot water—and many modern solar water tanks come with a built-in electric element for auxiliary heating when the sun isn't shining enough. In commercial settings, manifold systems link multiple tankless units together to dramatically increase their heating capacity while decreasing the individual load.</p>
<p>Gas-fired tank-type water heaters use a burner centered underneath the tank to heat the hot water storage tank, which in turn heats the water within the tank. You are left with a smile and a new warranty on your professionally installed water heater. Electric tankless water heaters still save homeowners around $44 per year according to the US Department of Energy. Another reason for sticking with the more popular tankless water heater manufacturers is for the reasons of maintenance.</p>
