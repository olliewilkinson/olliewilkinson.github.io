<p>A plumbing problem isn't always an if emergency , but when it is, wouldn't you like to be protected?

Installing an eligible solar or electric heat pump water heater entitles you to STCs, which can be sold to registered agents or traded individually. If it's a gas water heater use your two pipe wrenches and disconnect the union, that is between the supply pipe and the inlet pipe or it might be a flared fitting.</p>
