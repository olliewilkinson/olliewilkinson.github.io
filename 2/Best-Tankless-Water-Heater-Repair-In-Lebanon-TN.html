Call Lee's Plumbing: Once the plumbing experts arrive, they will assess the situation and walk you through the necessary repairs. These systems heat the water as it is requested, which is why they are also known as on demand” water heaters. Tankless models only require enough power to heat the amount of water needed at any given moment, meaning they use less energy, which translates to utility savings. It's important for homeowners in Bucks and Montgomery County to also consider the efficiency, cost, and size of their new water heater.</p>

If you are wanting to get a new water heater before a replacement is needed or you are wanting to upgrade to a new water heater, the plumbers at All About Plumbing & Septic are here to help you. Switching from a tank water heater to a tankless unit can be expensive because it requires you to retrofit your plumbing and possibly your electrical system. Tip: Routine upkeep on your water heater is a good idea.</p>
<p>Tankless usually cost between three and five times as much as a normal water heater for the initial purchase. The problem may be caused by the water heater's main breaker. Endless hot water, additional storage space and lower energy bills are just a few reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters. Tankless water heaters also take up much less space and can be installed virtually anywhere in your home.</p>

<p>Repaired 40 gallon gas water heater and installed thermal expansion tank. Perhaps a tankless water heater is right for you. Compared to traditional water heaters, tankless water heaters are smaller and can help you make the most out of your property's utility room space. When hot water is turned on at the faucet, a series of high-efficiency heating elements come to life, quickly heating the water as it passes through the system.</p>
<p>All hot water storage tanks include a critical safety feature: the temperature and pressure valve, which is often referred to as the T&P valve If the water gets too hot or the pressure in the tank is too high, the T&P valve will open and deposit water through a pipe running outside of the tank that usually ends 6 inches above the ground. The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>

So, when it comes to the selection and installation of your new water heater, you should rely on the experts America trusts for water heater services.</p>
<p>As such, this is the main reason you should focus on upgrading your water heater, as the old one is woefully out of date.

This can save you, on average, over $80 in hot water costs each year.</p>
