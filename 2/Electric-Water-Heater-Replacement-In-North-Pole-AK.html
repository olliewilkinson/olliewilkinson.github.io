<p>Water Heaters are a necessary household appliance that supplies all of your warm water needs, from cooking to bathing. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more often. We also want enough hot water for our needs and energy costs savings. Many people don't know much about water heaters or water heater repairs. A well-maintained tankless water heater can last for a long time. Typical anticipated lifetimes for these water heaters are 8-12 years for conventional and 10-15 years for high-efficiency.</p>
<p>Replacing a water heater usually costs $500 to $1,800 for a replacement of the same style and size. Another feature for the tankless water heater is a unit with an increased flow rate. The greater the desired Temperature Rise, the less Gallons per Minute of hot water can be produced. Our team of professionals is highly trained, knowledgeable, and experienced in all water heater installations and repairs. Such installation may result in an explosion or fire, but sometimes there may be no other choices.</p>

<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber North Pole AK</h3>
<p>Before you get a new water heater, you'll want to determine which system best meets your family's demands. Storage tank sizes are determined by the size and hot water requirements of the household it is to serve. The key is picking the most efficient water heater large enough to handle your needs. While a water heater replacement is needed on occasion, a lot of times homeowners and business owners don't know when a replacement is needed.</p>
<p>Your hot water is rust-colored: This is likely a sign that the inside of your tank is rusting, which means it's aging and breaking down. Another option, one that Petersen Plumbing is seeing more and more often in the market today, is the tankless water heater, sometimes called an on-demand water heater. From standard tank water heaters to tankless to solar water heaters, we offer a solution that will fit your needs and save energy.</p>
<p>Typically tankless heaters do not have standing pilot lights like tank type units, saving even more energy.

Reliable - With a properly sized unit, you'll always have a continuous supply of hot water at a preset temperature.

But it is important to note right up front that the cost of converting your current system to tankless or "demand" is more costly then substituting a conventional tank. If you want to save money, invest in professional water heater installation. Keeping your water heater in good working order is always the best first step.</p>
<p>Depending on your household size and personal energy-saving goals, a tankless water heater may be right for you. It is never recommended that you attempt to replace a gas or electric water heater if you are not specifically trained to do so. Improper installation of water heaters may cause fire or explosion. Knowing when your tankless water heater is malfunctioning or damaged will give you the knowledge to call for repairs at the right time.</p>
<p>If you don't know how old your heater is, your local plumber will be able to find out by reading the serial number on the tank.

Once the project is complete, your Installation Services Professional will familiarize you with the proper use of your new water heater and perform a final inspection of the project with you to confirm your satisfaction.</p>
<p>The majority of Houston homes use tank water heaters. Ensure that children can't reach the electrical sub-panel, outlet water pipes.
