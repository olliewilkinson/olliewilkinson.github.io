<h2>Water Heater Services Union Missouri</h2>
<p>All households require hot water, so your water heater is one of your most essential home appliances. As the name suggests, this type of water heater does not have a storage tank. Regularly scheduled maintenance can help extend the life of the water heater and it includes performing a water heater flush, checking the valves and connections for leaks and more. If you are not looking to apply more then one outlet then you would be well served by the standard and far less expensive model of the tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Flush the heater to remove sediment from the tank. First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube. Southern California Gas Company offers a rebate of up to $200 on Energy Star-qualified tankless water heaters for models with an energy factor of 0.90 or higher and $150 rebate for models that meet a minimum energy factor of 0.82. In order to get the rebate, however, you must be replacing a conventional tank-type water heater.</p>
<p>If you already have a tankless water heater, we can also perform necessary repairs and maintenance. Tankless hot water heater replacement estimates cannot be given over the phone. Rather they heat water as it passes through a series of coils in the unit. It involves removing the tank unit and replacing the venting and pipes with proper fittings and venting that is up to code for a tankless water heater.

<p>Even if a larger heater is available, there is always a size and weight consideration in an RV. Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon, so even if you had room for a 20-30 gallon unit, the extra 80-200 pounds of water plus the weight of the bigger unit is usually a problem. The higher the EF number, the more efficiently the water heater uses its energy.
