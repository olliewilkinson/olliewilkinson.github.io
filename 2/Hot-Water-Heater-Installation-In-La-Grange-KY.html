<p>Whether you are looking for a water heating system for your new home or your current system has seen better days and needs a replacement, one of the first things you need to do is to look at all of your available options and weigh their pros and cons.

These types of water heaters are able to last 20 years, whereas tank water heaters last 10 to 15 years.</p>
