<p>Double check the voltage on the circuit in the home's electrical panel and at the point it connects to the heater - most are 240 volts. You can expect to pay much less for your hot water when you use a tankless system. This is due to the fact that hot water tanks store water that can experience what is called "standby" losses, when heat evaporates through the flue or sides of the tank. As your water heater is used day in and day out, expect to have to perform some amount of repair.</p>
<p>Depending on your household size and personal energy-saving goals, a tankless water heater may be right for you. It is never recommended that you attempt to replace a gas or electric water heater if you are not specifically trained to do so. Improper installation of water heaters may cause fire or explosion. Knowing when your tankless water heater is malfunctioning or damaged will give you the knowledge to call for repairs at the right time.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, provide hot water only as it is needed. A tankless heater has a flow sensing device that is activated whenever a hot water tap is opened. A tankless heater only uses energy while it's heating water. Then, the temperature of your water will slowly decrease until the hot water in the tank has been completely replaced with "cold" water. These water heaters come up 98% efficient and once running will provide you with an endless stream of hot water.</p>

We have been so long in this business that we have witnessed the introduction of the first tankless water heater models in Dallas. Your actual savings depend on the type, size and energy efficiency rating of the hot water system you currently own. Accelerated Damage — the extra time that a tank spends heating water can cause the metal to turn brittle, which accelerates the likelihood of crack formation.</p>
<p>A concentric vent, which has an exhaust pipe inside a larger air-intake pipe, simplifies installation because only one hole needs to be cut in the wall. Turn on the water on the hot side at a tub spout and bleed all the air out of the water heater and water lines. A fully installed water heater can cost up to $5,000. Hard water (meaning it has a higher mineral content) in San Diego and surrounding areas causes a scale buildup that can damage heating elements.</p>
