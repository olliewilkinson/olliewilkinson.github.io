<p>Dirty Pilot & Burner Assembly: Periodic cleaning prevents water heater outages. When replacing this equipment be aware of electrical shock and very hot water. Discuss the two types of water heaters with your plumber to weigh your options. We need to put the new water tank in place being sure that the hot and cold water sides are properly lined up with the plumbing as it was before. Homeowners with on-demand water heaters typically use 50 gallons or less of hot water each day.</p>
<p>On a gas unit, also shut off the gas and unplug the electrical supply or turn off the circuit breaker. This happens because several feet of pipes separate the faucet from the water heater, and the water cools as it sits unused in the pipes. Flow rate: Flow rate refers to how many gallons of hot water the unit can provide in a minute. We will help you choose a water heater that is more energy-efficient and one that will work for your specific water needs.</p>
<p>You don't want to schedule annual maintenance for a tankless water heater, whereas a hot water tank can function without annual maintenance. First of all, installing a tankless water heater is a very complex method, so you should call a plumber to get it fixed. If the pilot light goes out after you light it, click the high-limit reset switch (sometimes called a door switch), located down by the viewing door at the bottom of the water tank.</p>
