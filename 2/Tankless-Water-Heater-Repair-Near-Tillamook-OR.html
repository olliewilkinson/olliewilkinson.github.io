<p>Water heaters can only be installed by an appropriately licensed plumbing contractor or registered plumbing worker and they must provide the household and the Office of the Technical Regulator with a certificate of compliance for the installation within seven days of completing the work. When you turn on a hot water valve or an appliance that draws hot water such as a washing machine or dishwasher, the gas-fired tankless water heater will draw cold water in through the cold-water inlet pipe on one side.</p>
