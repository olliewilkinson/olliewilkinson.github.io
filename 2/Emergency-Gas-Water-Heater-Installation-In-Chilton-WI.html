<p>1. Tankless water heaters require regular ongoing maintenance in order to run at their best efficiency. This requires a great deal of energy and puts incredible strain on the unit, which is why storage water heaters wear out after only eight to 12 years. In addition, SETS tankless water heaters are the only systems that offer a 100% lifetime parts replacement warranty.

<p>Whether you need to replace or repair your water heater, Service Experts Heating & Air Conditioning has the knowledge you need. Although tankless water heaters heat water on demand, they do have output limits on their flow rate. Gas water heater system installation (hot water heater system replacement) requires a plumber who is also a licensed gas fitter for the hot water system installation. Tankless water heaters are a higher initial cost, but they will cost less to operate because they only need to heat water as it is required and use less energy.</p>
<p>Solar water heaters are efficient but expensive. If you purchase a tankless heater by a good brand such as Bosch, Kenmore or American Water Heater, it can last as long as 20 years without being repaired or replaced. Sometimes they are called an in-line heater, as it only heats the water it needs as it passes through, and therefore energy is not wasted by heating extra water all day that is not in use. Knochelmann Service Experts Heating & Air Conditioning has skills to repair your water heater and have your household back to normal.</p>
<p>The only bigger percentage is heating and cooling costs. Tankless water heaters are heaters which work dynamically, heating water up as you request it, so no energy gets wasted storing any heated water, there's no bulk since the tankless water heater is just a small box, and you'll have no difficulties concealing it under a sink or behind a piece of furniture for example. We want you to know exactly what we're doing as we do it, both so you can be informed during the installation process and so you can properly maintain and understand your unit after it's installed.</p>
<p>Instead you'll have to remove the metal thermostat cover on the side of the water heater, pull out the insulation and hold the tester near the wires leading into the top of the high-temperature cutoff switch (see Figure A). Tankless units take about 15 seconds to bring water up to temperature, but you still have to wait for that hot water to arrive at your shower head or faucet, just as you do with a tank-type heater.</p>

A conventional water heater is a large, cylindrical tank with a heat exchanger inside.
