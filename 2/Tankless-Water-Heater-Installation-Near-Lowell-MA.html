<h2>Water Heater Services Lowell Massachusetts</h2>
<p>A gas hot water heater is the most common type you will find in most households. The best way to prevent emergency water heater repairs is to schedule regular maintenance for your system. Long lasting - Traditional tank water heating systems generally come with a warranty of up to 6 years. Here, the water is heated using either a gas burner or electric element as it passes through. If you've had enough of waiting for your water tank to heat the water, there is the option of a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Water is leaking from the hot water heater tank. However, as long as your water usage at any given time is below the maximum allowable flow rate, tankless water heaters provide an endless supply of hot water. This is often provided by either a flame, on a gas water heater, or a heating element, on an electric water heater. They may require a mechanical permit, gas piping permit and electrical permit depending on the local jurisdiction and what was required to install the new appliance.</p>
<p>Check that your electrical supply will adequately reach the tank. Black Pipe Fittings - You may need a few ½ black pipe couplings and elbows to extend or shorten the gas line connecting to the heater. Tankless water heaters are becoming increasingly popular due to the energy savings and consistent flow of hot water. Tankless models cost up to three times as much as a tank water heater, but they more than compensate for it with their unique benefits.</p>

<p>It is also a good idea to check the anode when you flush the heater, if you make this a routine you will be able to replace the anode before it is completely gone. Also, because they are not heating 40 - 50 gallons of water 24 hours a day, tankless water heaters are less susceptible to leakage than tank-type water heaters. Homeowners believing they now had cheap hot water tended to use a lot more water than before the solar heaters were installed.</p>
<p>Although there is an increasing number of homeowners who have successfully installed a tankless water heater themselves, manufacturers strongly encourage buyers not to. First and foremost, there is the issue of safety. Take a look at your current gas heater and notice the vent hood which is slightly above the top of the heater.
