<h2>Water Heater Services Cortlandt Manor New York</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Call (855) 982-2028 to schedule service with our water heater experts. Additionally, the water cools and is re-heated in the tank several times each day while no one is home.

Direct vent heaters are the recommended types of heaters to install.</p>
<p>Indirect water heaters use heat from a boiler. Radiant heating is a type of heating setup where the heat is supplied by electric wiring or hot water tubes installed into or under the flooring, and sometimes walls and ceilings. The steps for replacing a propane water heater are exactly the same, and those for an electric water heater are similar. They use electricity to pump heat from the air or the ground to your water tank, using less energy than traditional water heaters.</p>
