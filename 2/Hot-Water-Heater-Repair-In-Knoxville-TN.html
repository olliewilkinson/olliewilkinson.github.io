<h2>Water Heater Services Knoxville Tennessee</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>Water heaters need their own electrical circuits. If there is no hot water in the water heater, this may be because of a lack of power to heating the elements, such as tripped circuit breaker, a blown fuse handling water heater circuit, a faulty electric thermostat, or a faulty upper electric heating element. The good news is that newer hot water heaters aren't overly expensive and they will last for over a decade, making them a very good investment.</p>
<p>That's because homes here are usually equipped for a standard, storage tank water heater. You are not afraid of running out of hot water again since they instantly heat water instead of warming a large bath tub or pool perhaps. One solution to the long wait is to install a small tank water heater after the tankless water heater to act as a tempering tank, but once you do that, it's no longer a truly tankless system.</p>
