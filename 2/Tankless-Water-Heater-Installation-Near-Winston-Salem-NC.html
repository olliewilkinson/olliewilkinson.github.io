<h2>Water Heater Services Winston Salem North Carolina</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters eliminate the long wait for heat of the traditional hot water tank. 3)The amount of water that the heater allows to flow through is regulated by the desired outlet temperature. Condensing water heaters are an option if you heat with gas and need a unit with a capacity of more than 55 gallons. Planet Plumbing & Drain offers hot water heater replacement services in Boulder, Longmont and Denver metro areas.</p>
<p>Modern water heaters are also more efficient so a new water heater installation will also save you money on your energy bill. When you want help navigating the often confusing waters (no pun intended) of making the best choice of water heater for your home, you'll be pleased you contacted the professionals at Petro Home Services today. A tankless water heater in Tacoma or Seattle also ensures that you always have access to hot water because you won't have to wait for the tank to heat.</p>

Yes, some problems with water heaters can be repaired but not all. This cuts down on the water heater's efficiency and its ability to adequately heat the water.</p>
<p>Because hot water is essential to our everyday lives, it is important to manage and maintain your hot water heater. Tankless heaters do not have a large standing water supply, instead they instantly heat the water to the necessary temperature as it is required. Hybrid electric heat pump water heaters don't work well in very cold spaces. We will send out an experienced hot water heater contractor to resolve your water heating issues and to help your home continue operating like it was meant to.</p>
<p>Many people are going towards getting tankless water heat so that they do not need to keep it maintained of another appliance. Energy Efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water, using about 35% less energy than a tank water heater. While it's true that the T&P Valve is likely to leak after testing it, the danger involved if it failed makes the risk of a leak worth it. If you want to see what could potentially happen due to a failed T&P, just Google "water heater blast" and check out the video at the website of that name.</p>
<p>However, you may need to hire an electrician at $50-$100 per hour to rewire your home because they require much more energy than gas units. Convenience: Your dependable tankless water heating system means you'll have all the hot water you need for your business needs, instantly, just when you need it. Check your work by first filling the tank with water and making sure that there are no leaks in your plumbing job.</p>

<p>It's just a matter of time before your water heater will need to be replaced and it is always better to schedule it out than deal with an untimely breakdown. Replacing your hot water tank can be a costly venture. In comparison, the average life expectancy of an electric tank water heater is about 12 or 13 years. If you have a bulky storage model that seems to be guzzling electricity or gas then you should replace it with the latest tankless direct vent gas version as this can enable you to save around 10% to 30% in your energy bills.</p>
