<h2>Water Heater Services Upper Darby Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>Your water heater is your last defense for dealing with freezing cold water, which is why you should always stay on top of regular maintenance and care. Whether it's powered by electricity or natural gas, your water heater isn't built to last forever. Once the system is all hooked up and properly tested, you're ready to start using your new water heating system. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that in homes using 41 gallons or less of hot water, on-demand tankless units can conserve between 24% to 34% more energy than tank water heaters.</p>
<p>Install the temperature and pressure relief valve (T&P) discharge pipe so that it flows down toward the discharge point. When debating which water to invest in or switch to, consider these alarming statistics about at-home water usage and the differences between all the water heaters on the market. When you rely on Clarke & Rush for tankless water heater repair or replacement, you can expect professional service from a skilled plumber.</p>

This isn't just the cost of buying and installing the heater but how much it will cost to run it over time.</p>
