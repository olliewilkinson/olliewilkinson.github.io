<h2>Water Heater Services Godfrey Illinois</h2>

Replacement or installation of shutoff valves for water and gas.</p>
<p>Fortunately, since tankless heaters do not have a tank, there is absolutely zero risk of an explosion ever occurring. Sometimes the hot water tank in the system is the only one used to provide the home with hot water—and many modern solar water tanks come with a built-in electric element for auxiliary heating when the sun isn't shining enough. In commercial settings, manifold systems link multiple tankless units together to dramatically increase their heating capacity while decreasing the individual load.</p>

<p>Failed heating elements, faulty water heater thermostats, or discolored water all indicate a problem with your water heater.

<p>If you are insulating your pipes for your water heater, do not cover dielectric unions, fittings, or copper flex lines. Tankless water heaters produce water faster than a traditional heater.
