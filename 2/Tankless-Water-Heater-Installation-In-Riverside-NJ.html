The greater the desired Temperature Rise, the less Gallons per Minute of hot water can be produced. Our team of professionals is highly trained, knowledgeable, and experienced in all water heater installations and repairs. Such installation may result in an explosion or fire, but sometimes there may be no other choices.</p>
<p>Instead, when a flow-activated switch comes on, the heat exchanger turns on and heats the water as you need it. Tankless water heaters come in point-of-use styles like a coffee pot plumbed into the water system, or as whole-house units.

By combining these costs over a pre-determined period of time, we are able to understand and compare the total cost of ownership.

If your existing hot water heater is good, just requiring maintenance, minor repairs, or new fittings, we can get you working again in no time.</p>
