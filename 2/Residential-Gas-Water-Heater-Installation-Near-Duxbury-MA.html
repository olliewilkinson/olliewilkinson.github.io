<h2>Water Heater Services Duxbury Massachusetts</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>During the course of an average home occupancy, a resident is bound to face that moment where they need to replace a water heater. Traditional tank water heaters can become rusted or corroded over time. They constantly heat water so hot water is consistently prepared. Importantly, all types of tankless water heaters use at least some electricity to operate the control systems. Run clean water through the heater for a few minutes, using the same pump arrangement as before.</p>
<p>An especially significant motivation is the 50% reduced heating costs over using a hot water tank. If you got a water heater that only worked for two people, it's not going to work as well when there are four to 10 people working or living in space. If you already have a booster installed in your home, we are also a water heater booster repair company and we service boosters as well. Whining noises indicate sediment has built up on the heating element and will cause lower water temperatures.</p>
