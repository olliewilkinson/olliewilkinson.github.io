<h2>Water Heater Services East Peoria Illinois</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Been a back to back winner of BEE Energy Award and MNRE Awards, Racold has reached the epitome of innovation with its solar, electric and gas based water heaters. While far from difficult, installing an electric water heater does involve plumbing and electrical work, which may be enough to put off quite a few people. Units that support recirculation deliver instant hot water more efficiently. When you notice a noise, shut the water heater and call for professional help.</p>
<p>Whether you repair or replace, water heaters will perform better and last longer if you flush the tank once a year to remove sediment. If you are not 100% confident installing an electric water heater, Lowe's recommends that you hire a professional. Gas units are often a little higher costs for installation because of the venting required. If the water starts out in the middle of the heater for instance, it will leave the heater after only being in the pipe for half the time it would need to reach full temperature.</p>

<p>Although there is an increasing number of homeowners who have successfully installed a tankless water heater themselves, manufacturers strongly encourage buyers not to. First and foremost, there is the issue of safety. Take a look at your current gas heater and notice the vent hood which is slightly above the top of the heater. The longer lifetime of tankless models means homeowners incur less expense repairing and replacing the water heater.</p>

Whether you'd like an electric water heater, gas water heater, or an energy-efficient tankless water heater, our skilled plumbers can help with the selection and installation.
