The water heater is capable of heating nearly 4 gallons per minute in cold weather, or up to 6 gallons during summer months.

<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>

<p>When installing an exterior model you need to insulate the pipelines. A direct vent water heater is basically a sealed unit that has either two pipes or a concentric pipe pipe within pipe to suck in fresh air from outside the bathroom and also dispense exhaust gases outside. Cold weather Internal heaters keep components toasty down to −22-degrees F, but exposed water pipes must be insulated and wrapped in heat tape that turns on automatically in freezing temperatures.</p>
