You don't want to simply get the biggest water heater available, as this may be more than you need and you'll still pay to keep the entire tank hot all of the time. Are similar to conventional units in that they both burn gas, exhaust flues and store hot water in an insulated tank.

Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>
