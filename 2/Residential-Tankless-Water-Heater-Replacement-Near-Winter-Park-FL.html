<h2>Water Heater Services Winter Park Florida</h2>
<p>All homes need to have hot water, and your water heater is what makes it happen. Don't wake up every day to a long wait for hot water—or worse, an icy cold shower. If you have an electric water heater, this will mean being wired into the home's electrical grid. Get valuable information if you are considering replacing your existing water heater with a new tankless water heater. If your water heater is older and you need frequent repairs to keep it running smoothly, a new unit is likely a good idea.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater.

Another one of the advantages that comes along with using a tankless water heater is that it lasts a lot longer than your standard water heater. It is best to have a professional take care of these type of issues as there are electrical and water hazards involved in making these repairs.

Within the heat exchanger, there is an electric resistance coil that warms the water to the desired temperature as it travels through. Conventional water heaters store water at the forefront of time and use your home's electricity or gas power to heat somewhere between 30 and 50 gallons of water.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as demand-type or instantaneous water heaters, provide hot water only as it is needed. As shown in the photo, a tankless water heater has its components housed in a steel box that's designed to be mounted on the wall. This means as long as you have water flowing, and don't run out of whatever fuel (propane, electricity, etc.) you use to generate the heat; you have continuous hot water.</p>
