<p>There are leaks at the base of the water heater tank. Use pipe that is rated for hot water such as copper or CPVC. Under no circumstances do working water heaters need to be replaced. They're efficient, durable and 80 percent smaller than conventional hot water tanks. This means a newer installation is nearly guaranteed to provide quicker, more efficient, and more effective hot water delivery. Calculate the maximum simultaneous demand for hot water in the house, and you'll know which system(s) should be installed and where it should be located.</p>
