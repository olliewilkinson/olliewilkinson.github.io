<h2>Water Heater Services Bentonville Arkansas</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>Water heater failure can happen anytime and may lead to your tank fully discharging, potential damage and temporary loss of service. Specialists from Downey Plumbing Heating & Air Conditioning will help you reach your goals when it comes to water heating systems. The tankless water heaters also cause an increase in water wastage since you have to let the water run longer to get your hot water. Before finalizing everything, make sure that you do enough comparison with the existing heaters that are out in the market.</p>

<p>Most heaters range between 110V to 277V. You don't get the problem of frequent maintenance or servicing with a Rinnai tankless water heater, because there's no tank to leak or break and no risk of flooding.

If you are switching from electric to a gas water heater installation, the gas hot water heater installation cost would typically be in the $1200 to $3000 range.</p>
