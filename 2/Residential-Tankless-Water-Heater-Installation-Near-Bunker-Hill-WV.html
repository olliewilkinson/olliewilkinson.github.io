<h3>Hot Water Heater Replacement Bunker Hill</h3>
<p>A hot water heater is the thirty to fifty gallon tank tactfully closeted in your kitchen, bathroom, or some other well-concealed space. In water heater tanks, one of the most common problems is corrosion. Hot water heaters work hard day in, day out — until they don't. Only heats water when you need it, so energy isn't wasted for hot water that's not needed right away. Many people try to cut water usage in an effort to reduce this lost energy, but they don't realize that the heat is still generated throughout the day, whether or not they actually use the hot water in the tank.</p>
<p>It only heats water when you are calling for hot water and heats only in the amount that you need. Ninety degree bend on the top could be an obstacle for the venting, so it's good if there is much vertical rise at the top of the heater, as this allows the exhaust gas to easily emit out. Roto-Rooter plumbers are experts at water heater leak repair. However, if you're looking to make your home more energy efficient, our technicians may recommend replacing a less-efficient unit with one that heats better and uses less energy.</p>
<p>Pick the water heater that best fits your water usage, lifestyle situation, and budget. When you are not using hot water, the heater's internal sensor automatically switches off the heat exchanger. However, installation costs are lower owing the absence of a furnace. The gas hot water heater should utilize a removable anode which helps to prevent chemical reactions between the chemicals present in the tank which may cause erosion.</p>
<p>Even if a larger heater is available, there is always a size and weight consideration in an RV. Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon, so even if you had room for a 20-30 gallon unit, the extra 80-200 pounds of water plus the weight of the bigger unit is usually a problem. The higher the EF number, the more efficiently the water heater uses its energy. Through increased efficiency and regular maintenance and repairs tankless water heaters can positively impact your energy bills.</p>

When you turn the hot water tap off the heat exchanger shuts down, saving energy and money. B&B Heating & Cooling are Homer Glen's tankless water heater specialists.</p>
