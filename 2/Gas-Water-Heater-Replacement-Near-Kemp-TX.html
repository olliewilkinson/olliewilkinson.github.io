However, tankless varieties are known to last longer than conventional water heater models which translates to a 20+-year useful life, as compared to storage tank types which last only 10 to 15 years before falling apart due to corrosion or part failure of some sort. Depending on where you have the water heater located inside your house, a leak could result in significant property damage.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Kemp Texas 75143</h3>
<p>Whether you need a new water heater installation or some help with maintenance, you can trust our plumbing experts to help keep your home and family comfortable. Besides energy and cost savings, there are several other reasons to choose a tankless water heater over a traditional tank-style heater. Tankless units are complicated. Gas hot water not working is unusual, as gas hot water systems tend to be very reliable.</p>
<p>8. A good indicator for both electric and gas heaters is the sacrificial anode rod. Your water heater is under constant stress to deliver enough hot water for your family. There are some less common causes that can make your electric water heater not as effective or efficient as it used to be. A water leak could be the cause as to why the hot water doesn't reach the showerhead and faucets. A cold climate can push tankless heaters right up to the limits of their capabilities.</p>
<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>Our dedicated, expert technicians have extensive training and years of experience in the installation of new, high performing and energy-saving water heaters. Installing heating systems in your home can help you maintain a constant temperature. A tankless water heater only heats water when it's needed, which means lower water heating costs and no more having to worry about running out of hot water. Once the project is complete, your Installation Services Professional will familiarize you with the proper use of your new water heater and perform a final inspection of the project with you to confirm your satisfaction.</p>
<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
