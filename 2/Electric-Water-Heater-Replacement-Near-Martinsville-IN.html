<p>When shopping for your next water heater, your fuel source will be the first variable to consider when sorting through options. Many times, the handyman of the family will see a new hot water heater or a tankless hot water heater in the household supply stores. A huge puddle of water all over your basement floor and it is coming from the bottom of the water heater. Keep the drain valve in the front as best as you can to easily drain out water later on in the water heater's life.</p>
<p>If the temperature sensor (9) detects that the water exceeds or falls short of the desired setting, the panel will adjust the gas valve, the mixing valve, and the flow-regulating water valve (10) accordingly. Water heater problems are a good example of when this choice is important. Along with our furnaces and boilers, our water heaters are also available in various styles, efficiency levels, and brands - one of which includes the Navien brand.</p>
