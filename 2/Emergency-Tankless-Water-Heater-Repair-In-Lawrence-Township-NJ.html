<p>Are you struggling with a broken water heater? Energy efficiency is a good starting point but there are other things we need to look at. Assuming that you are going to go with the more efficient tankless heater the most important pieces of information you need are the climate zone you live in, how many gallons of hot water you expect to use during the most demanding part of the day and how much you would pay for utilities, if you have a choice.</p>

Condensing gas heaters can extract up to 96 percent of a fuel's heat—a 17 percent improvement over first-generation tankless units—thanks to a second heat exchanger that captures much of the exhaust heat before it goes out the vent.</p>
<p>Water heaters are dangerous and can cause a variety of hazardous conditions both for the person attempting to tinker with the heater and for the residents of the entire household. Indirect water heaters cost $800 to $1,500 on average. If the buildup is left unattended and the tank has rusted, it is time for a new water heater altogether.

<p>When your water heater breaks down, you want to call someone you can trust. Accordingly, the best place to install a tankless system is directly next to the water fixture. For a simple install with no need to run additional gas lines to a new hookup, an install will take an average of around 3-4 hours for a total installation cost of $150-$600. Over time, even well-maintained water heaters will begin to lose efficiency and develop more problems associated with wear and tear.</p>
<p>In the one tank system, the solar storage and the backup heater are all part of the same unit, and in the two-tank system, the solar component in the system heats the water before it is fed through to the water heater. That's right, some people actually see their gas bills go up because more hot water is being used since there's more available now.

<p>Low Capacity: The water heater that was originally installed in your home was not designed to keep up with a growing family and modern appliances. Many newer water heaters use a new electronic control valve called the Honeywell Smart Controller. Consumer Reports recently tested four electric and five gas whole-house tankless water heaters from such brands as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless to see how costs, performance, and energy use stack up against that of conventional storage tank water heaters.</p>
