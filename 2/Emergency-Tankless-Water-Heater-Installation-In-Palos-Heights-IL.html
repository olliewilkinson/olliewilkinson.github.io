<h2>Water Heater Services Palos Heights Illinois</h2>
<p>Tankless water heaters, both gas and electric, are pretty much in demand these days, as they are considered to be one of the most energy efficient appliances available today. Gas-fired tankless water heaters produce higher flow rates than electric ones. Some popular models include Bosch Aquastar 2400ES Gas Tankless Water Heater, GE Indoor Tankless Gas Water Heater Model GN94DNSRSA and Rheem Tankless Water Heater RTG-74PVN-1, Indoor Use.

<p>Flush the heater to remove sediment from the tank. First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube. Southern California Gas Company offers a rebate of up to $200 on Energy Star-qualified tankless water heaters for models with an energy factor of 0.90 or higher and $150 rebate for models that meet a minimum energy factor of 0.82. In order to get the rebate, however, you must be replacing a conventional tank-type water heater.</p>

<p>Gas-burning tankless water heaters should operate for 20 years or more, two or three times longer than tank-type heaters. The dip tube in your water heater makes sure the incoming cold water is distributed evenly throughout the tank.

<p>In addition to installing your new tankless water heater, we offer tankless water heater replacement service.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Palos Heights Illinois 60463</h3>

Tankless water heaters Wall-mounted tankless units heat water on demand, only heating as much as is required for your needs. It's important to keep in mind the amount of water that can be heated via a tankless system (0.5 to 2 gallons per minute for a single point heater and 5 - 10 gallons per minute for a whole house unit).</p>
<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions. With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason. While tankless hot water heaters are generally more efficient than conventional water heaters, we can help you maintain your conventional water heater, or install a new conventional water heater, in a manner that will allow your conventional water heater to run just as efficiently as many tankless hot water heaters.</p>

<p>Gas water heaters will have a higher FHR compared to an electric heater with the same sized tank. It's estimated that gas water heaters last for up to 10 years and electric ones up to 15 ‚ but don't think you don't have to maintain and troubleshoot certain things about your hot water heater to meet, or even exceed, these projected lifetimes. The installation process is more time-consuming, and fewer plumbers know how to install them correctly.</p>
<p>Depending on the service load of your home, you may need an electrician to install a larger breaker to provide you with enough power. Most tank-style water heaters won't live past 20 years. Press the probe tips against the terminals of the heating element (one probe to each screw). Energy efficiency of your water heater can be improved through its correct installation and maintenance. A bonus: Without all that gunk inside, your water heater will operate more efficiently, saving you money.</p>
