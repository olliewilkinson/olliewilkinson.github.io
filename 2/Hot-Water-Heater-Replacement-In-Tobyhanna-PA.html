<p>The only time most people really spend thinking about their water heaters is in the middle of winter, when they get up in the dark to take a hot shower and they're blasted with a jet of icy water. Regardless of the power source, the water stored in their tank will remain hot for several days. If there's a major problem with your water heater or it's more than 12-15 years old, it may be time to consider a new one.

<p>Before you get a new water heater, you'll want to determine which system best meets your family's demands. Storage tank sizes are determined by the size and hot water requirements of the household it is to serve. The key is picking the most efficient water heater large enough to handle your needs. While a water heater replacement is needed on occasion, a lot of times homeowners and business owners don't know when a replacement is needed.</p>
<p>This includes inspecting the pressure relief valve, burner assembly, filters, anode rod and power supply that's heating the water. An electric water heater could easily short out, causing more damage to the heater or leave you in a dangerous situation. If your hot water heater is not working, it can be tough to go about your daily routine. These details are important and easy to get to.

<p>A small electric spark that ignites the gas usually starts the units, little cause for alarm. But it is important to note right up front that the cost of converting your current system to tankless or "demand" is more costly then substituting a conventional tank. If you want to save money, invest in professional water heater installation. Keeping your water heater in good working order is always the best first step.</p>
<p>Please contact a professional to fix and maintain your hot water heater. Turn off the water inlet and outlet valves on the water heater. When it comes down to powering the heating process, tankless water heaters use 30-50% less electricity than water storage tank models.
