<h2>Water Heater Services Hewlett New York</h2>
<p>If you had installed your storage tank water heater when fuel and electricity were abundant and cheap, then you would have realized that times have truly changed for the worse. Lee's provides a wide range of water heaters for installation, but if you're concerned with energy-efficiency, then a tankless water heater (also known as on-demand water heaters) may be just right for you. Our courteous professionals can help you determine what is right for your budget, home, and lifestyle as you look at different water heaters. Tanks of some storage water heater types are heavily insulated, which substantially reduces standby heat losses and cuts annual operating costs.</p>
<p>The innovative changes in gas valve function to heater designs alone are unequaled. We recommend talking to a licensed professional before making the final decision on a water heater purchase. If your water heater is at least 10 years old, it may be time for an upgrade. For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time can stretch a tankless water heater to its limit. Energy savings, endless supply of hot water, low operating cost, reduced risk of power problems, space savings and durability, and safety and assurance are the other advantages.</p>
<p>Get estimates for how much it will cost to update your home's current venting as well as its current electrical system or gas fittings. Today's plumbing code requires all tank-style water heaters to have a temperature and pressure relief valve that opens to release pressure and eliminate the possibility of the tank exploding. Traditional water heaters are easier and less costly to install, but they do cost more to run.</p>

<p>Further, a tankless gas water heater has a life span of 10 to 15 years. If your water heater is no longer producing hot water, or if the tank is leaking, you need to take care of it right away. If the tankless system costs $2,200 installed, and saves $116 a year, it would take about 19 years to break even on the investment. Point-of-use units are used to quickly supply hot water to a source not located near the home's central water heater.</p>
<p>Whether you need scheduled maintenance or emergency water heater repair, Brown's Heating, Cooling & Plumbing has the trained plumbing technicians ready to assist you. A Direct Vent water heater is similar to a standard water heater in configuration. Self-cleaning units automatically fight lime and sediment buildup to lengthen tank life and maintain peak efficiency for a longer period. Although flushing your water heater storage tank and replacing the sacrificial anode rod are ways to actively maintain your water heater, improving the quality of water within your home is a way to passively maintain your water heater.</p>
<p>Natural gas tankless water heaters have more output of hot water compared to an electric water heaters. Most water heater brands will not warranty parts if the heater is not maintained properly. As you might expect, this controller is more expensive than a mechanical gas valve, as are its replacement parts.

With fewer components and no bulky water tank, you will require fewer repairs and your unit will last about 5-10 years longer than a traditional unit. Storage tank water heaters store 40 to 120 gallons of water at a time and constantly reheat that water regardless of how much is actually demanded.</p>
<p>These heaters are useful in residences as well as commercial establishments, and can be used in single and multiple unit set ups. A good quality water heater not only reduces the repair and maintenance charges but also acts as an energy saver. Gravity fed water heaters meet the water flow rate requirements and do not require a water efficient shower head or flow restrictor to be installed. It is important to understand that a plugged temperature and pressure relief valve on your water heater can turn your water heater into a dangerous time bomb.</p>
