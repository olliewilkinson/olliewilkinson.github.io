<h2>Water Heater Services Livingston California</h2>
<p>Water heaters can run into several problems if not maintained properly. We provide prompt, reliable repairs and service. Because of their high-powered burners, tankless heaters need to be installed in a well-vented space for safe operation. They repeatedly heat water so hot water is always ready. Water heaters are fired by gas or electricity. Water leaks and gas leaks can be fixed by tightening the connections or soldering the pipes. Tankless water heaters also have limited output. Whether you're looking for a quick repair or a comprehensive installation, Time Plumbing, Heating & Electric Inc.</p>
<p>Our team of technicians can take a look at your water heater to determine the issue and provide you with an effective solution.

<p>The new line of A. Smith electric tankless water heaters provide an energy efficient and easy-to-install solution for your home or business. Whether you have an electric or gas water heater, it needs something to cycle the heat on and off. This means that water heaters should be set above 115 degrees in order to prevent the build-up of the bacteria in the system. If your current water heater is old, it's likely a conventional tank water heater.</p>
