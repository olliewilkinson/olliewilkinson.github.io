<p>If your water heater is around 10 years old and it's got a major mechanical problem, replacement is usually your best option. Your tankless water heater can provide you with endless hot water for years to come with the right repair and maintenance from Central Plumbing.

<p>Your water heater's heating elements and thermostat can also wear out, leaving you with a fluctuating temperature or no hot water at all. Leaks and drips, the pressure valve and even the pilot light going out are other common troubleshooting areas that hot water heaters may present, whether they're located in a commercial or residential facility.
