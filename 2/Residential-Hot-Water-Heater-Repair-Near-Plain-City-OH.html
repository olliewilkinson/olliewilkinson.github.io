A typical lifespan for a Rinnai water heater is 20 plus years in a residential location and this is almost twice as long as a tank. A conventional tank constantly heats stored water, is good for high usage demands and is economical. Plumbers must get a special certification in order to perform gas plumbing services, and the average homeowner simply doesn't have the knowledge to do these tasks safely.</p>
<p>Also, if you live in an area where most of the homes are upgrading to tankless units, it may be a good idea to do the same so your property remains in competitive with the rest of the area homes (from a real estate standpoint). The gas tankless water heater installation cost would also be in the $250 and $700 range to replace an old tankless system with the same type in the same spot.

However, if you prefer to install your new water heater DIY-style, be prepared to spend a couple of hours in order to finish the whole setup. The first step in installing a tankless system is ensuring all components of the system are correctly designed including properly sizing pumps, managing water pressures, determining correct numbers of circulating units, and providing for freeze protection.</p>
<p>In the one tank system, the solar storage and the backup heater are all part of the same unit, and in the two-tank system, the solar component in the system heats the water before it is fed through to the water heater. That's right, some people actually see their gas bills go up because more hot water is being used since there's more available now. Rumbling Plumbers associate rumbling sounds with water heater complications.</p>
<p>You may have a short in the heating element or a thermostat problem. Tankless water heaters are typically more expensive than conventional models, with prices ranging from $600 to $2,000, plus installation; in comparison, a standard water heater runs between $300 and $1,000.

<p>A small electric spark that ignites the gas usually starts the units, little cause for alarm. But it is important to note right up front that the cost of converting your current system to tankless or "demand" is more costly then substituting a conventional tank.

When using a conventional water heater, rust and scale build-up can collect in the interior of the storage tank. A power vent tankless water heater will function best when it is installed in an area with adequate airflow around it for combustion to take place.
