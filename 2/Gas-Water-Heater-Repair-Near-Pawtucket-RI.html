<h2>Water Heater Services Pawtucket Rhode Island</h2>
<p>When you need to repair your water heater and you have forgotten where you put your warranty or manual, it helps to have some tips to guide you along the way. You don't want to have to deal with issues with your water heater installation such as having to re-install it, leaks, or having to spend money to replace it.

While they can be much more expensive than traditional units, tankless water heaters do deliver big long-term savings.</p>
<p>Water heater type: Whole-home tankless units provide hot water to all plumbing fixtures in your home, while point-of-use (POU) units only provide hot water for a single appliance or area (like the kitchen or laundry room).
