In the case of the gas tankless water heater installation you are required to have a PVC vent installed that penetrates the roof of your home or that you mount it on the outside of the home and purchase a special outdoor tankless water heater which may also require an enclosure and re-working your water supply lines.</p>

<p>Buyers must also have realistic expectations regarding the performance of the tankless water heater they intend to buy. The tanklees electric water heater heats the water immediately when it is turned on. There is a heating element, or several heating elements, in the pipe and as the water flows over them, it gets heated up. These appliances are easy to install, provide great value, require less maintenance and offer every member of the family an unlimited supply of instant hot water.</p>
