<p>But likewise, even though the problem may be similar, the repair solution is considerably different from a traditional tank heater. We'll consider whether you prefer gas or electric service, how much hot water your property demands, and how much available space you have for a new tank. Many a times, water heaters start with a slow leak at the base or around a corroded fitting, that is when you really need to get it checked.</p>
<p>It pulls heat from your boiler, indirectly heating the water. Electrical Issues: Modern water heaters rely on electrical sensors and components to function properly. Bill Smith Plumbing & Heating will help you select just the right water heater that matches your lifestyle, home and budget. The bottom line is that, despite its undeniable efficiency and longer life, the increased cost of installing a tankless water heater might not make it financially feasible right now.</p>
<p>The process of heating the water is triggered when the tankless hot water heater senses the demand for hot water, which occurs when you turn on the hot water tap. In this case, the expanding water flows into the expansion tank rather than your pipes. Removal of a water heater requires the power source to be disconnected and the tank to be completely drained. Our energy saver installation service saves you time and energy.</p>
<p>Low Capacity: The water heater that was originally installed in your home was not designed to keep up with a growing family and modern appliances. Many newer water heaters use a new electronic control valve called the Honeywell Smart Controller. Consumer Reports recently tested four electric and five gas whole-house tankless water heaters from such brands as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless to see how costs, performance, and energy use stack up against that of conventional storage tank water heaters.</p>
<p>On the other hand, gas tankless water heaters need you to have the right kind of gas - which could either be propane or natural gas - before you install any unit. Plus, with technology that operates only when hot water is needed, ultra-efficient heating coils, no pilot light and no storage tank, you save on energy and utility costs. Energy Efficiency: As water heaters age, they become less energy efficient, using more gas or electricity to generate less hot water.</p>
