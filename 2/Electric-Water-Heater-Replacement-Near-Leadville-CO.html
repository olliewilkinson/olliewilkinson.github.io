<h2>Water Heater Services Leadville Colorado</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>A 2-gallon expansion tank works with water heaters up to 50 gallons. The build-up of excess sediment inside your water tank may cause it to heat a lower volume of H2O. Multiple units can be plumbed in parallel to increase the volume output of hot water. 2. Tankless water heaters deliver hot water faster. Because tankless models can deliver better performance and energy efficiency - that's why. We are the most trusted HVAC contractor, providing professional water heater installation and repair services.</p>
<p>If you live in a warm or temperate climate, where the groundwater temperature is always above 55 degrees Fahrenheit, you will be able to run one main hot water fixture (a shower, bath, dishwasher, washing machine or kitchen sink), and a bathroom sink at the same time. While this is not something that people are too happy about, it is so important to get a replacement for your water heater when it is needed.</p>
