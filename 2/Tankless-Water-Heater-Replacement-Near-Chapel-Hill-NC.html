<h2>Water Heater Services Chapel Hill North Carolina</h2>
<p>When choosing a tankless water heater to go with, you have to first decide between tankless electric water heaters and tankless gas water heaters. Missing and improperly installed T&P discharge pipes are a common problem. Before you disconnect and remove your existing water heater, be sure to do all of the necessary preparation—you don't want to be stuck without hot water for a week or two while you're waiting for needed plumbing, electrical, or vent work.

Seeing water on your basement floor usually means that your water heater has outlived its existence.</p>
<p>The maintenance necessary for your water heater depends on location, design of the unit, quality of installation, water quality, and manufacturer recommendations. You usually notice a leak when there is a puddle around the bottom of the water heater or they may be a trail leading back to the tank. Note: Unless the water heater stopped working more than a few hours ago, the water spilling out will be hot. Instead of storing heated water in tank, it supplies water only when needed.</p>

A common misconception is that a water heater which has stopped functioning has to be replaced. With these units, you don't have to ever worry about a rusted tank that leaks. The power source for a tankless water heater needs to be readily accessible in the area where the tank is installed. Many people choose to simply use the same type that they are using presently, while others are influenced by the purchase price, the cost of running the heater over time, how energy efficient they are and how long it takes for the water to heat.</p>

When you are not using hot water, the heater's internal sensor automatically switches off the heat exchanger. However, installation costs are lower owing the absence of a furnace.

Water travels in pipes through solar collectors (typically installed on your roof), where it is heated by the sun. Turn on the cold water supply valve to the water heater and turn on the water supply valve (or the house water supply, as applicable). Traditional storage water tank heaters, also known as "boilers" are the most common water heaters installed for the last 120 years or so and are used for central heating and can also heat the water for your home using steam.</p>
