<p>Modern units are much more energy efficient however, so consider the money you will save on utility costs when deciding whether to repair or replace yours. Have an assistant help load the old water heater onto the appliance dolly and remove the old unit.

Our water heater repairs and replacements are reasonably priced and affordable, so you can rest assured that we won't bring you any hidden surprises.</p>
<p>Determining whether you should repair your water heater or purchase a new one depends solely on what is wrong with it in the first place. They know from experience which models of heaters tend to hold up the best to the hard water. Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity. Tankless systems heat water by activating a set of coils that become hot when the unit is turned on. As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Gas or propane fueled tankless water heaters have better power efficient but more complex installation process. A tankless water heater system operates by using a line or pipe. Instead, heating elements are used that heat the water as it is needed. I would draw the line at trying to install a power-vented gas-fired water heater (and some other specialized models). Whether you choose gas or electric, there are many ways to get savings out of a tankless hot water heater.</p>

<p>Problems such as rusty or discolored water, strange noises or low or no heat are also indicators it's time to get your water heater repaired or replaced. A tankless water heater is also called an "on-demand" water heater, because it only heats water when you turn on the hot water tap.

<p>A booster is a highly useful device that can help your small heater act like a larger one, and it can even save you energy and space in your home. The further away a fixture is from the water heater, the longer it takes for the water to heat up. There are other types of a tankless water heater and it is up to you to choose what is best for your whole house needs or commercial needs. You will get your hot water faster and the outlet temperature will be a little higher, so you use less hot and more cold when taking a shower.</p>
<p>More expensive low-density elements are usually folded back like the one shown in Photo 5. These provide the same amount of heat but spread out over a larger surface area, which lowers the surface temperature, making them less prone to mineral buildup. Keep a distance of 24″ between the combustibles, the water heater, and the output hot water pipe. Colder climates mean colder incoming groundwater temperature, resulting in a need for more energy to heat the water to your desired temperature.</p>
