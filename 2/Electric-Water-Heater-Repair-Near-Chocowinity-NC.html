Electric water heaters tend to be more energy-efficient than gas water heaters, but the cost of electricity can make the electric the more expensive choice. Whereas with a tankless hot water heater all you have to do is turn off the water supply to that location disconnect the supply lines and you are basically finished.</p>
<p>A tankless water heater uses a heat source (electric or gas) to warm up cool water on-demand whenever you need it rather than storing hot water in a tank. A water heater expansion tank is a must if your home runs on a closed water supply system. Water heater repair is what is required, hence get in touch with a plumber. After paying another plumbing company $70.00 to give me a crazy estimate of $2,500 to replace my water heater, I began calling other plumbers asking for a free estimate.</p>
<p>But, optimizing the location relative to the plumbing fixtures in your home or business will also reduce your energy bill and water consumption. In fact, your home's gas piping, gas meter and gas line to the meter may not be sized appropriately to handle the high gas load that will be replacing the conventional storage gas water heater. The next indication that you can use to determine you need a new water heater is that there is an actual leak on the tank itself.</p>

Once the gas meter's capacity is confirmed, determine whether the gas line is also adequately sized to supply enough gas to the water heater.

<p>If you're like most homeowners, you probably don't give your water heater a second thought. A new and up-to-date water heater can save you a great deal of money on your utility bill. It activates when the pressure inside the water heater becomes too great. Turn off the breaker to the water heater's circuit in the service panel. You may also find a continuity tester called a water heater tester” near the replacement elements.</p>
<p>Tankless hot water heaters are also a good choice for most retro projects, and should be considered a good choice for second homes and weekend retreats where the percentage of standing hot water is wasted. Flexible copper connectors are easier to install than solid copper, especially when the existing pipes and the tank inlets don't line up. But not all local codes allow them. Age of the Heating Unit: The average life of a water heater is about 8 to 12 years.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are not a simple swap out.” Most conventional gas water heaters were not installed with a tankless retrofit in mind. No storage tank saves valuable space. The tankless heater compared to a conventional heater has unlimited hot water and can deliver for hours not limited by the tank's capacity. When you turn the hot water tap in a home with a tankless water heater, a powerful gas or electric heater kicks on and instantly heats water running through coils in the unit.</p>

<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
<p>Overall, there are situations where a hot water tank is a better choice over a tankless water heater. Vents also need to be installed to ventilate the unit.
