The right water heater can keep your baths and showers comfortable, your dishes clean, and your clothes washed—all at a temperature that works best for the soaps you're using.</p>
<p>While scale can shorten the life of the heating element, you don't need to invest in fancy features to get a water heater that lasts. Tankless heaters can be installed underneath sinks or in small closets as well as in traditional hot water tank enclosures. As a result, their expected equipment life is possibly longer - more than 20 years, compared with 10 - 15 years for traditional heaters. We have a range of gas and electric tank water heaters offered in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>
<p>Gas-powered water heaters must vent out combustion fumes safely from the system. Unlike a storage tank water heater, which loses heat from the tank continually and must keep using energy to heat it up again, a tankless system only works when needed.

Your Assured Comfort plumbing experts will thoroughly examine your water heater, and explain the issue and your repair or replacement options.</p>

<p>When the demand for water ceases, the unit shuts down and uses no energy, a revolutionary advantage over a standard water heater. Deciding which water heater offers the best value comes down to a number of factors, such as fuel source, efficiency, water usage, and size. A 100-gallon storage tank is going to take up a lot of room, and buying a water heater that is too large can cause all sorts of problems. The benefit of tankless water heaters in that scenario is that your whole family can take showers back-to-back without worrying about running out of hot water.</p>
<p>Traditional storage water heaters. Less expensive to run - Because these systems only consume energy when there's a demand for hot water, they're more fuel efficient than storage systems, which must keep up a steady supply of heat to maintain water temperature. 1) I needed a unit big enough to supply me with hot water for at least one shower and sink running at the same time. These models deliver continuous hot water when you need it and they can be easily installed in places where tank water heaters can't go, including closets and bathrooms.</p>
