<h2>Water Heater Services Wellington Kansas</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>Energy efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water. Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time. Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits. You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>
<p>Gas-fired tank-type water heaters use a burner centered underneath the tank to heat the hot water storage tank, which in turn heats the water within the tank. You are left with a smile and a new warranty on your professionally installed water heater. Electric tankless water heaters still save homeowners around $44 per year according to the US Department of Energy. Another reason for sticking with the more popular tankless water heater manufacturers is for the reasons of maintenance.</p>

If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>

<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>

<p>These heaters are useful in residences as well as commercial establishments, and can be used in single and multiple unit set ups. A good quality water heater not only reduces the repair and maintenance charges but also acts as an energy saver. Gravity fed water heaters meet the water flow rate requirements and do not require a water efficient shower head or flow restrictor to be installed. It is important to understand that a plugged temperature and pressure relief valve on your water heater can turn your water heater into a dangerous time bomb.</p>
