<p>Do you need water heater repair for your gas system? Venting of current hot water heater: via chimney or through the wall. All costs are for the unit only, this does not include installation, transportation or additional costs. A tankless water heater typically relies on an in-line filter to prevent sediment and other solids from entering and clogging the heat exchanger. Price with installation: Varies dramatically depending on the type, brand, your home, and whether you are installing a new heater or replacing an old one.</p>
<p>From standard tank water heaters to tankless to solar water heaters, we offer a solution that will meet your needs and conserve energy. This means that you might need a larger unit or multiple units if you have a simultaneous demand from multiple showers, faucets, or other hot water consumers like a washing machine. At Care Temp, LLC, we install and repair standard and tankless water heaters in Toms River, NJ, as well as in Brick, Jackson, Manchester, Lakewood, and the surrounding areas.</p>
