<p>Hot water system replacement cost will vary with the complexity of the hot water system replacement. This will also cause the water heater to work harder to heat the remaining water inside the tank because it is losing hot water through the leak.

<p>We'll make sure that it can provide plenty of hot water for you and your family and that it meets or exceeds your energy efficiency goals. Efficiency: If your water heater is of an older make and model, upgrading to a new, energy-efficient appliance will pay for itself over time. If you're ready for a worry-free water heater, set up an appointment with a John Moore Technician to see if a John Moore Lifetime unit would be a good fit for your home.</p>
