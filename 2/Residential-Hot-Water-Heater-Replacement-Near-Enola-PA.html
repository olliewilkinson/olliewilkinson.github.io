<h2>Water Heater Services Enola Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most common and easiest way to heat water is by the use of a gas hot water heater, and this might be due to the fact that gas is capable of getting the tank up to operating temperature roughly twice as quickly as its electric counterpart, and the cost is also approximately half as much as electricity would cost. Tank water heaters are great and very reliable, but if you are looking for a more energy-efficient that can save you a lot of money, tankless water heaters are the way to go. At All About Plumbing & Septic, we are able to repair and replace tankless water heaters, as well as provide quality water heater installation service More and more people are investing in tankless water heaters because when it's not in use, it doesn't consume energy; with traditional tank water heaters, they are constantly heating water within in a tank.</p>
<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call. A tank-style water heater expends energy around the clock to maintain the temperature of a 40 to 50-gallon water supply so that hot water is ready when it's needed. Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>
<p>This problem is only compounded as sediment build up in the tank over time and reduces the amount of hot water the tank can store. In the case of installing electric tankless water heaters you may be required to have an electrician upgrade the electrical service to your home or plug, depending on its age and set up.

When the stored water cools due to standby heat loss, a thermostat in the tank triggers the reheating process. And because the heat pump is on top, a hybrid water heater needs as much as 7 feet of clearance from floor to ceiling.</p>
