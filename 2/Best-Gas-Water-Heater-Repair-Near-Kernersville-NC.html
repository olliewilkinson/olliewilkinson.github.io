<h2>Water Heater Services Kernersville North Carolina</h2>
<p>Regardless of whether you live in a rented apartment or your own home, hot water heater technology plays a very important role in your everyday life. In the instance that there is not enough hot water and you have ensured that the tank is not leaking, you can flush the tank so that mineral deposits are not reducing its efficiency. If your water heater is exhibiting any of the above signs or if it has stopped working all together, it's time to call in your local professionals. Gas heaters are also historically less expensive than electric heaters to run. When repair costs begin to outweigh the benefit it's time to replace your tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Usually, these tanks hold enough hot water to meet the needs of the entire house. When we install a new water heater, our water heater experts will ensure that any gas and electrical connections are handled safely, and the water heater is installed properly. Endless hot water and lower energy bills are two reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters. You can enjoy consistent hot water by scheduling professional service when it's needed.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters usually need more gas than even the biggest home furnaces. We have been specializing in San Jose water heaters including installation, replacement & repair since 1968. Keep in mind, there is always a direct relationship between the amount of power in and the output temperature of your hot water. This could be because the heating element itself needs to be replaced or because the power supply isn't reaching the element.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Kernersville</h3>
<p>Instead of a vent, electric tank-type water heaters have a 220-volt power supply cable going into the top of the hot water storage tank that supplies electricity to the thermostat and heating elements. Traditional storage water tank heaters, also known as "boilers," are the most common water heaters installed and are used for central heating and can even heat the water for your home using steam. We install these new units all the time, and our customer love how much move it saves them on their utility bills each month.</p>
<p>While replacing most hot water heater parts is fairly easy, it is not entirely without risk. One advantage is that since the tankless unit does not have a tank, there is no continuous heat (energy) loss from the large volume of stored heated water, as there is with a traditional storage type heater. Purchasing a tankless water heater will cost you a quite a bit more than a traditional water heater. With tankless water heaters, there is no more need for pipes running throughout your home, as they can be easily installed in your bathroom, kitchen, or garage, right at the point of use minimizing the associated piping.</p>
<p>If you notice any of the symptoms above, your water heater system likely requires repair or replacement. As mentioned above, tankless water heaters are smaller than traditional tank heaters. If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>
<p>We were also rather lean with our 15 year estimated lifetime for the whole-home tankless gas water heater, which is suggested to last longer than 20 years and in fact carries a longer warranty then the gas storage water heaters. Installing our water heater is really as easy as reversing everything we just did. From repairs, installations, and upgrades, our technicians are known for getting the job done right every time.</p>
<h3>Need A Plumber Service Kernersville NC</h3>
<p>Older water heaters that use a tank can be quite large and take up a lot of space. The colder the incoming water the more heat the heater has to create. This can put a lot of strain on an average system, in such cases it could be wise to install more than one heater. The breakdown of your hot water heater can be from both preventable and unpreventable causes, such as a buildup of mineral scale, a disconnected gas or power supply, a problem with the temperature pressure release valve, and vent obstructions.</p>
<p>But you save energy, since you don't have that full tank of hot water leaking heat into its surroundings 24 hours a day. Weigh the pros and cons before it's time to replace your traditional hot water heater. Tankless water heaters are a modern type of heater that work towards helping you achieve that goal. Sometimes, a water heater problem can be solved with a simple repair, in which case we will use high-quality parts.</p>
