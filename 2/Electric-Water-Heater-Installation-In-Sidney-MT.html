<h2>Water Heater Services Sidney Montana</h2>
<p>When choosing a tankless water heater to go with, you have to first decide between tankless electric water heaters and tankless gas water heaters. Missing and improperly installed T&P discharge pipes are a common problem. Before you disconnect and remove your existing water heater, be sure to do all of the necessary preparation—you don't want to be stuck without hot water for a week or two while you're waiting for needed plumbing, electrical, or vent work.

In commercial settings, manifold systems link multiple tankless units together to dramatically increase their heating capacity while decreasing the individual load.</p>
