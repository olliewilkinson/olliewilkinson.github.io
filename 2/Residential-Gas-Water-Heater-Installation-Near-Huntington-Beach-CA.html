<p>This makes tankless water heaters take longer to deliver hot water. Although hot water heaters can differ from model to model, they all operate on similar ideas. There should be a large circular opening near the bottom of the heater to attach the new temperature and pressure relief valve to. If you don't see one, consult the manufacturer's guide. They can range from the usual water heaters that simply store a tank of hot water for the household's use.</p>
