<h2>Water Heater Services Sterling Virginia</h2>

With all this in mind, it's generally better to let an expert install your tankless water heater. If you start to hear rumbling from your water heater, keep an eye out for any small leaks. Keep in mind, however, that most conventional gas tank water heaters were not installed with a tankless retrofit in mind. We install new water heaters here in Natchitoches. A new energy-efficient water heater will help save you some money in energy costs each month.</p>

<h3>Affordable Hot Water Heater Replacement Sterling</h3>
<p>If your family has grown larger or smaller, this is a good time to consider upsizing or downsizing your water heater. A traditional water heater stores hot water in a large tank. You'll need to have the water heater cleaned out, but we also strongly recommend installing a water softener to eliminate the problem at the source. With tankless electric water heaters, there is a direct relationship between the flow rate of a fixture (demand), the power supplied to the tankless electric water heater, and the output temperature of the hot water.</p>
<p>For example, an electric heat pump water heater typically is more energy efficient than an electric conventional storage water heater. When you call Covenant Plumbing, we will help you decide if it's time to replace your water heater and guide you to a water heater replacement that is best for the needs of your home.

This pump needs more space and hot weather conditions are suitable for it. Moreover, its installation cost is very high in comparison to other water heaters.

You may receive energy savings of 27 to 50 percent if you put on-demand water heaters at all hot water outlets in your home. However, one should make sure that the tank is installed in a safe place and is secured to a strong structure such as a wall in regions that are prone to earthquake, as it minimizes the chance of a gas fire happening by turning off the gas connection in the event it that the tank falls over.</p>
<p>Most modern tankless water heaters operate in the range of 11,000 to 199,000 BTUs per hour. If you're planning to sell your home in the near future, and you fear your existing water heater may not last, I would consider the lower upfront cost of a conventional one, or at most upgrade (for the improved marketability) to the high-efficiency gas storage water heater, rather than incurring the additional expense of a whole-home tankless gas water heater.</p>
<p>In addition to installing your new tankless water heater, we offer tankless water heater replacement service. If it's a conventional storage-tank water heater nearing the end of its 10 to 13-year life, replacement is obvious: New models are up to 20% more efficient and can save up to $700 in energy costs over the life of the unit.
