However, tankless varieties are known to last longer than conventional water heater models which translates to a 20+-year useful life, as compared to storage tank types which last only 10 to 15 years before falling apart due to corrosion or part failure of some sort. Depending on where you have the water heater located inside your house, a leak could result in significant property damage.</p>
<p>This could result in precious pre-heated air from within your home being sucked into the heater creating a negative pressure, while any exhaust gases could be released inside the house itself and pose a danger to you and your loved ones.

Turn on the cold water supply valve to the water heater and turn on the water supply valve (or the house water supply, as applicable). Traditional storage water tank heaters, also known as "boilers" are the most common water heaters installed for the last 120 years or so and are used for central heating and can also heat the water for your home using steam.</p>
