Single point heaters cost around $150 each and are suitable for areas with smaller capacity demands such as bathroom showers, and they are generally electrically powered. As a rule of thumb, water heaters are not designed to last much beyond about 10 to 15 years (more or less).

<p>Some of the common geyser repairs that we encounter and fix are overheating of water, water not heating enough or not heating at all, rust colored water, automatic heating function not working, water dripping from geyser (leakage), etc. To install the water heater in its place, start by pre-screwing the 4 bolts from your fixing kit into the rods.

Colder climates mean colder incoming groundwater temperature, resulting in a need for more energy to heat the water to your desired temperature.</p>
