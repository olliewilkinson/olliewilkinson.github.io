If your plumbing or electrical system requires upgrading to permit the use of a tankless heater it can be extremely expensive. Water heaters are not simple appliances. This can add to the your water heater cost. This means that it will take much longer for your water to get hot while you run the faucet waiting for it.

<p>Energy Savings: Because these units only heat water when it's needed, you can save big on energy costs.

Try turning the unit off then back on again.</p>
