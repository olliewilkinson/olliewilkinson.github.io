<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work. The age is also going to be affected by how much this water heater is used, as more wear and tear can cause the product to age faster. Old hot water heaters have parts that are worn. Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>
<p>It will be necessary to lower the temperature of the water in the tank. We proudly offer our customers the best water heating systems on the market.

<p>When you are ready for your shower you push a button and the pump sends the heated water from your water heater to your fixture more quickly than if you run the shower at full blast, and the pump shuts off when the hot water reaches it. Thus you save time, water, energy, and money. Tank heaters must always keep water warm after heating it. This process means that they continuously cycle on and off to keep water warm.</p>
<p>Check the surrounding pipes for leaks that could damage the water heater. After the hot water tank in the system is an expansion tank installed to help keep pressure levels in the system at safe levels.

<p>But likewise, even though the problem may be similar, the repair solution is considerably different from a traditional tank heater. We'll consider whether you prefer gas or electric service, how much hot water your property demands, and how much available space you have for a new tank. Many a times, water heaters start with a slow leak at the base or around a corroded fitting, that is when you really need to get it checked.</p>
<p>Tankless gas heaters don't store water and so you don't pay to keep gallons of water at a high temperature as in the tanks of electric hot water heaters. When you're dealing with a broken water heater, AC unit, or some other indoor comfort issue, you want to make sure the company you call will work with you to fix it, and not just provide a service to mask the real problem. Whether you're looking for a more efficient water heating system or simply need help repairing your current water heater, you are sure to get professional help from us.

<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>Gas units just heat water faster than electric, tankless or otherwise. A traditional water heater has an average lifespan of 10 to 15 years, but they can fail without warning. When it comes to quality, Noritz takes no short cuts in producing the highest quality tankless water heaters. A properly installed and insulated conventional water heater will save you money on your energy bills without requiring any modifications to your existing ventilation, power supply, or gas supply.</p>
