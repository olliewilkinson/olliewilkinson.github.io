Our experienced technicians are equipped and trained for electric water heater repair. When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution. Traditional water heaters work by heating and storing a set amount of water in a tank. Turning on hot water throughout the home activates the heater, even if the pilot light is not on, so you are able to check the pipes for leaks much more easily.</p>
<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
<p>If you know the different types of water heaters available in the market, it is easier to make the right decision when purchasing one.

<p>Similar to the video directly above, it also shows how to test the thermostat and elements, but it does a particularly good job of showing details such as the exact screws and terminals to test with a multimeter and how to use the multimeter. If a gas water heater is incorrectly vented, hot gases can present a fire danger inside the walls. Until, of course, the water heater suddenly stops working, and all that hot water that once flowed freely is nothing but a near-freezing stream — not something you're thrilled to take a shower in.</p>
<p>Because water heaters are in constant contact with water, it's common for them to deteriorate over time. The overall cost of owning a water heater will depend on a number of factors such as the number of people using the heater, operating expenses, and remodeling done in the home. Nothing lasts forever, least of all a water heater. The calcified minerals clog the drain valve, slow the heating process, overheating the bottom of your tank and affecting the metal integrity of your tank's walls to the point where leaks can and do occur.</p>
