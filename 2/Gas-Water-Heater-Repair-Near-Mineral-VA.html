<h2>Water Heater Services Mineral Virginia</h2>
<p>Thermal couple repair is probably the most common repair on a gas fired water heater. Most, if not all codes require that gas burning equipment be installed where they have enough air to "breathe". The type of fuel required will affect not only the operating costs but also the purchase price of your tankless water heater. If you currently have a water heater that's in fine condition but you are looking to upgrade to a new one, the plumbers at All About Plumbing & Septic are able to help you.</p>
<p>In most cases, if the water heater isn't heating water, the electrical elements inside it are not getting hot. If your hot water tank is over 15 years old, it's at the end of its natural life and you're better off getting a new one. You expect the best for your home, family and business, so it makes sense to trust the #1 selling gas tankless water heating brand in North America for all of your water heating needs.</p>
<p>Attach the vent pipe to the draft hood on the water heater (for gas water heaters only). A properly sized unit with sufficient air and gas inputs will provide efficient, on-demand hot water for your customers, leading to increased comfort and long-term savings. Now it's time to establish the cold (usually right side) and hot (usually left side) water connections. On a chilly day, it can take several minutes for hot water to travel from the hot water heater tank to your shower.</p>

<p>Energy Savings: Because these units only heat water when it's needed, you can save big on energy costs. Water heaters are essentially steel tanks with vitreous glass bonded to the inside to protect the steel from rust. Retrofitting a home with a tankless unit can be a complicated process as compared to traditional storage tank and may cost as high as $3,000. Gas water heater: Turn off the gas supply at the shutoff valve on the gas pipe nearest the water heater.</p>
<p>This could result in precious pre-heated air from within your home being sucked into the heater creating a negative pressure, while any exhaust gases could be released inside the house itself and pose a danger to you and your loved ones. Call 480-212-6587 and ask the experts at Affordable Plumbing, Rooter and Water Heaters about the benefits of a tankless water heater. These requirements are an important part of the government's efforts to improve the energy and water efficiency of homes and to lower greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>If you have water on the floor or on top of the unit (this is different from water leaking from a supply line above the unit), you'll probably need a new water heater.

Your water heater works silently around the clock to give you a constant supply of warm water. Look out for the energy factor (EF) too, as this indicates how well the unit can converts its fuel to heat. Water quality is an important consideration for all water equipment, and water heaters will often be impacted the most.</p>
