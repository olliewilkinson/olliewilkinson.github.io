They do require a storage tank, unlike conventional tankless water heaters, but because an indirect heater uses the boiler or main furnace to heat the fluid circulated through a heat exchanger in the storage tank, the energy that's actually "stored" by the tank lets the furnace turn off and on less frequently.</p>
<p>Water consumption (amount of hot water to be used) is another important factor in determining which heating system to purchase. Denver water is quite cold, which creates condensation on the walls of hot water storage tanks. Electric water heaters use, you guessed it- electricity, to heat the water.
