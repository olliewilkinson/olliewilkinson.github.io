A home that has a water heater that's too small for its needs will constantly be out of hot water, and a water heater that's too big for the household is a waste of money. A tankless water heater system allows you to have the hot water you want on demand without any hassles.</p>
<p>It's measured in Gallons Per Minute or GPM, the higher the GPG, the more water can be heated at the same time. In a large home, or if you have a big family and heavy water usage, you may need to install two or more tankless models. The main factor is the cost of the water heater itself.

Hybrid models function like conventional storage tanks, but they use a heat pump to extract energy from the air. With a replacement, you can have a water heater that doesn't require frequent repairs, and you can have a more energy efficient water heater. Another advantage is that tankless heaters have a longer life span those ordinary heaters.</p>
<p>If you can't confidently say you know how to install a water heater you really need to use caution. As opposed to waiting for a storage tank to fill with enough hot water for use, tankless water heaters provide a constant supply of it. If you're looking for an energy-efficient option to supply your home with hot water, tankless water heaters are worth serious consideration.

<p>Typically tankless heaters do not have standing pilot lights like tank type units, saving even more energy. For example, the Stiebel Eltron Tempra 36 measures about 14x36x5 inches and may be installed just about anywhere you will find proper electrical and plumbing connections. Reliable - With a properly sized unit, you'll always have a continuous supply of hot water at a preset temperature.
