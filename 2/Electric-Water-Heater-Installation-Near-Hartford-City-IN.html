<h2>Water Heater Services Hartford City Indiana</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>This is because the flow of energy is easier to regulate with an electric connection, plus the pilot light has to be properly ignited with a gas connection. And no tanks means no hot water sitting unused, reducing your overall heating costs by hundreds of dollars.

<p>With tankless water heaters, there is no tank to store water, so you'll always experience fresh and clean hot water because the unit heats water on demand as it passes through the unit.

Additional costs include other materials needed for installation (heat pumps, water pumps, pipes, etc.) and the costs associated with permitting These may add $250 to $500 to the final cost.</p>
