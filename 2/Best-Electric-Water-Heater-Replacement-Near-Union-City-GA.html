<h2>Water Heater Services Union City Georgia</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>Water heater failure can happen anytime and may lead to your tank fully discharging, potential damage and temporary loss of service. Specialists from Downey Plumbing Heating & Air Conditioning will help you reach your goals when it comes to water heating systems.

We offer service in traditional gas and electric water heaters.</p>
