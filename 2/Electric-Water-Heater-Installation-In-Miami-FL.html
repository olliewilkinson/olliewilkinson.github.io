<h2>Water Heater Services Miami Florida</h2>
<p>Your next door neighbor was up all night dealing with a busted water heater and you just spent the last half hour listening to him complain. Solar water heaters use a storage tank that stores water heated by the sun. Haven Heating and Air Conditioning is your local tankless water heater repair specialist, get in touch with us today. It's these two things: Flow Rate and Gallons Per Minute that determine what size heater you need and whether it should be gas or electric. There are several factors that can affect your water heater. Whether it's installation of a brand new tank or tankless, repair of an existing tank or preventative and regular maintenance to ensure that your tank is operating at its maximum potential, the experts at AirPlus Heating & Cooling can handle it. We are able to quickly and efficiently install a new unit in your home, should it be beyond repair.</p>

Condensing water heaters are an option if you heat with gas and need a unit with a capacity of more than 55 gallons. Planet Plumbing & Drain offers hot water heater replacement services in Boulder, Longmont and Denver metro areas.</p>
<p>The more people and the more simultaneous usage possibilities, the greater the GPM needs to be. One solution is to install multiple tankless units to meet the demands of a large household, but that can become very expensive. A typical tankless water heater can produce between 7 and 15 litres of hot water per minute. However, if you have a long term commitment to your current residence, a whole-home tankless gas water heater may be a viable option.</p>

When a new water heater installation becomes the only option, you will have a couple of different options from which to choose, depending on the size of your home and how much hot water you use each day.

<p>They can cut your water heating bills in half and earn you a nice utility rebate from Duke Energy. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day.

Regular maintenance is required for a longer life of a water heater.</p>
<p>Gas-powered water heaters must vent out combustion fumes safely from the system. Unlike a storage tank water heater, which loses heat from the tank continually and must keep using energy to heat it up again, a tankless system only works when needed.

Your Assured Comfort plumbing experts will thoroughly examine your water heater, and explain the issue and your repair or replacement options.</p>
<p>Not every house or business is going to use the same energy source to run their appliances, which is why it's so great that tankless water heaters can either be electric or gas. However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>

And if you need your existing system serviced or repaired, our professional, factory-trained technicians will identify the issues and make repairs. With a typical shower flow-rate of 2.5 to 3 gallons per minute (or slightly less with modern fixtures and flow restrictors), most tankless heaters will not be able to keep up with a secondary demand, for instance, from a dishwasher, clothes washer, or second shower location.</p>
