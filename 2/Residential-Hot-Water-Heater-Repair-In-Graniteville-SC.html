<h2>Water Heater Services Graniteville South Carolina</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call. A tank-style water heater expends energy around the clock to maintain the temperature of a 40 to 50-gallon water supply so that hot water is ready when it's needed. Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>
<p>Direct vent heaters are slightly higher in efficiency over standard water heaters but are significantly less efficient than tankless water heaters. The statistical life expectancy of a storage tank water heater is 10-12 years, depending on care and maintenance. For those suffering from a leaky water heater, John Moore can even repair your water damaged walls and floors without the headache of dealing with multiple contractors.</p>
<h3>Affordable Hot Water Heater Replacement Graniteville</h3>
<p>Instead, it uses powerful heating elements to heat the water as it flows through the pipes. A tankless unit only works when you need it, cutting down on your costs considerably. With reduced energy usage, reduced water consumption, less sewage, and an on demand system, tankless water heaters are a green alternative to hot water tanks. Beacon Plumbing specializes in replacing old water heaters or repairing them.</p>
<p>Check out the Energy Saver 101: Water Heating infographic to learn if a tankless water heater is right for you, and our #AskEnergySaver discussion on water heating for more answers on efficient water heating. Heavy rust and water streaks are signs of danger and the time to replace the unit right away. Water heaters come in various types such as atmospheric vent, power vent, power direct vent, direct vent, and combo water heaters.</p>
<p>The good thing is that they can be replaced; however, this is another instance where a professional plumbing tech should look the heater over to see if there aren't any other glaring issues. As such, the most dangerous problem that could ever occur would be a serious leak with your water heater. If you closed the hot water faucet, you should open it again, as well as the T&P valve This will help the water drain faster by allowing air into the tank.</p>
<p>Rinnai water heaters qualify for energy efficiency rebates too. Heat pump and hybrid tanks start at almost double what you would typically pay for a traditional tank water heater. This process removes dirt and scaling from the immediate pipe area and confirms that the Y-fitting was installed properly. Tankless , heat pump, and solar water heaters offer even bigger savings and also qualify for a federal tax credit These products could cost three to five times more to buy and install, so consider payback carefully.</p>
<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Graniteville SC</h3>
<p>Once a new water heater of the proper size has been selected, it needs to be hooked up to the waterline. Hybrid models function like conventional storage tanks, but they use a heat pump to extract energy from the air. With a replacement, you can have a water heater that doesn't require frequent repairs, and you can have a more energy efficient water heater. Another advantage is that tankless heaters have a longer life span those ordinary heaters.</p>
<p>To keep your hot water tank in tip top shape and ensure it lasts as long as possible, call us for annual water heater maintenance. So now if your ready to buy a new tankless water heater, the only thing left you require is help with the installation. Instead they heat water as it passes through the unit, using a heat exchanger to rapidly bring it up to temperature. One of these factors is the power source of the water heater.</p>
<p>The rate of hot water produced by a tankless water heater is two to five gallons per minute, depending on the heating style used. The very same holds true for refurbished tankless water heaters. Installing a water heater costs $800 and $1,506, or an average of $1,125, including the unit and labor. On average, you can expect your tankless water heater unit to last a minimum of 20 years before it needs major repairs and replacement.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
<p>I have been using Plumberx services for long time, could not be happier. A tankless system heats the water on-demand when you need it through a series of super-heated coils. While tankless heaters are extremely efficient over time, while they are running they need a good deal of electricity. Ventilation is vital for gas burning water heaters. When you hire us, we guarantee that we will provide you with the highest-quality of products, and offer you an honest, upfront cost to install your tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Type: Traditional water heaters tend to be most common. With all the choices on the market; tank or tankless, gas or electric, number of gallons, etc., your options may seem overwhelming. Experience and skills mean that you're getting the job done right, which helps to ensure that your water heater lasts as long as possible- they can have a lifespan of between 10-20 years, depending on various factors. If you need water heater repairs, installations, or replacements, our team of water heater experts can help you.</p>
<p>Of course, the TP valve or pipe could still be warm if the water heater stopped working within the last 3 or 4 hours because the water inside would still be holding some heat. Tankless heaters are much more expensive than ordinary water heating systems. Regardless of the type of water heater that is in your home, it is an inevitability that you will experience some kind of issues with it. Usually, this is in the form of no hot water coming out of your faucets or shower.</p>
<p>Your water heater's heating elements and thermostat can also wear out, leaving you with a fluctuating temperature or no hot water at all. Leaks and drips, the pressure valve and even the pilot light going out are other common troubleshooting areas that hot water heaters may present, whether they're located in a commercial or residential facility. Wait a little while, then check the water temperature at a faucet.</p>
