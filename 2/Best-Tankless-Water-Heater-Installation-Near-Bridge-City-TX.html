<p>If your family has grown larger or smaller, this is a good time to consider upsizing or downsizing your water heater. A traditional water heater stores hot water in a large tank. You'll need to have the water heater cleaned out, but we also strongly recommend installing a water softener to eliminate the problem at the source.
