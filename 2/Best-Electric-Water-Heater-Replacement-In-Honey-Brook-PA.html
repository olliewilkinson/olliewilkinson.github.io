<h2>Water Heater Services Honey Brook Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element.

If you purchase a tankless heater by a good brand such as Bosch, Kenmore or American Water Heater, it can last as long as 20 years without being repaired or replaced. Sometimes they are called an in-line heater, as it only heats the water it needs as it passes through, and therefore energy is not wasted by heating extra water all day that is not in use.

<p>Whole-home tankless gas water heaters have specific flow rates that are relative to the necessary temperature rise. With new water heater efficiency standards, we now have the opportunity to have it all. Although gas and electric water heaters can lose some efficiency because water is constantly being heated in the tank, current efficiency standards are much improved over the past. Most water heaters are gas, so even the smallest of mistakes made during installation can cause added expenses, property damage, injury, or even death.</p>

We can also recommend a preventive maintenance plan that will keep your water heater in working order. As the water flows across the heating elements, it gets hot. Age is the most common reason your water heater will need to be replaced, though consistent problems with leaks and sediment build-up may require more than just repairs.</p>

Tank water heaters store water and heat it on demand, while tankless water heaters heat the water using coils, without storing it. Tank water heaters are generally less expensive and can accommodate high-demand households, while tankless are more expensive up front, but can reduce your energy usage by around 30 per cent.</p>
