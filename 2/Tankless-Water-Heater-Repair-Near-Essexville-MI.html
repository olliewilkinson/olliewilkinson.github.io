<p>At Gary's Plumbing and Heating, we service all your water heating problems. The sentiment has also moved into the world of plumbing, where tankless water heaters have become popular for their ability to deliver hot water anytime it's needed.

Now it's time to establish the cold (usually right side) and hot (usually left side) water connections. On a chilly day, it can take several minutes for hot water to travel from the hot water heater tank to your shower.</p>
