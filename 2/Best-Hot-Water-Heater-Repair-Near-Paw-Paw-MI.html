Like our other services, your new water heater will be covered by our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee for a year. This heat from the pilot flame causes a tiny electrical signal to be sent to the control valve, telling the control valve that there is a flame present so it's OK to let the gas through to the main burner when the thermostat calls for heat.</p>
<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: Yes, most tankless water heater repairs require a professional. A great way to start changing the house from being less dependent on traditional energy sources and electricity companies to install solar hot water panels. The basic gas heater installation requires the properly sized tankless water heater, venting components, extension of the hot and cold piping, an electrical connection and a gas connection.</p>
<p>More expensive low-density elements are usually folded back like the one shown in Photo 5. These provide the same amount of heat but spread out over a larger surface area, which lowers the surface temperature, making them less prone to mineral buildup. Keep a distance of 24″ between the combustibles, the water heater, and the output hot water pipe. Colder climates mean colder incoming groundwater temperature, resulting in a need for more energy to heat the water to your desired temperature.</p>
<p>The difference between the two is how the water is heated, via electrical resistance coils or natural gas. These kinds of tankless gas water heaters, like the Bosch 2400EO-NG natural gas outdoor water heater, helps eliminate the need for vents. Some of these issues can be addressed by installing a tankless water heater. For expert water heater repair in the Orange County area, look to your neighbors at Barker and Sons Plumbing & Rooter.</p>
