The most important decision regarding water heaters will be choosing whether you want to install a unit with a conventional storage tank or a tankless model.</p>
<p>An expansion tank is a safety system for water that expands when it heats up. Most have a little room inside for expansion. A conventional water heater is a large, cylindrical tank with a heat exchanger inside. You will definitely want to have an expert take care of the installation if this is the first time a natural gas water heater is going to be installed in your house, as this will ensure that there is a large enough gap between the interior walls and the tank to prevent any possibility of fire.</p>
<p>These systems are also sometimes called on-demand water heaters because they only heat water when there is an immediate need for it. So there is no energy being wasted to maintain a tank of hot water that might not be used for hours, days, or even weeks if you are not at home. On the positive side, and despite the sticker-shock price tag, a tankless heater may be the best solution in a remote or infrequently used location.</p>
