<h2>Water Heater Services Needville Texas</h2>
<p>Thermal couple repair is probably the most common repair on a gas fired water heater. Most, if not all codes require that gas burning equipment be installed where they have enough air to "breathe". The type of fuel required will affect not only the operating costs but also the purchase price of your tankless water heater. If you currently have a water heater that's in fine condition but you are looking to upgrade to a new one, the plumbers at All About Plumbing & Septic are able to help you.</p>
<p>Energy efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water. Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time. Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits. You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>
<p>If you want your water heater to be replaced with a Mike Diamond Plumbing water heater we are happy to still keep your planned appointment. In any case, when you're planning a water heater replacement, play it safe. If you think that your hot water heater is failing, or you just purchased a home and aren't sure about the condition of your heater, it's important to work with a water heater inspection company to evaluate your system.</p>

<p>For example, having a shower and operating the dishwashing system at once might stretch a tankless water heater to its boundaries. When you want to lower your energy bill a homeowner can improve this by replacing any old water heaters. Our hot water tank technicians are authorized installers of the best tanks in the industry such as Navien®, Noritz® and Rinnai®. One of the downsides of apartment living is that you're not necessarily in control of your own water heater.</p>
<p>Electric tankless water heaters assist in reducing the energy consumption within your home by not having to heat water in storage tanks that goes unused. Longer Lifespan: Generally, a tankless system will last a lot longer than the water heaters with tanks, because they're not in constant contact with water. This problem can be solved by using a demand hot water pump, which in combination with the tankless heater can get your hot water to you at less than half the time it would take running the faucet full blast, and the pump doesn't run water down the drain, so you save not only time, but water as well.</p>
<p>Check the main switch on the water heater and the circuit breaker (or fuse) that serves the water heater. A tankless water heater is more expensive than its traditional counterpart. The only problem I found with it, which I later discovered that it is common to all brands of this water heaters is that the installation can be expensive, since you may need upgrades to pipes and additional electrical work. In addition, water in a tank has to be heated hotter than necessary to account for these stand-by losses.</p>
<p>If your water heater is old and breaks down, you may be better off replacing it, as the average repair costs more than half the average cost of replacement. Assured Comfort repairs and services all brands of residential and commercial hot water heaters. Gas water heater: Confirm that the gas supply is shut off at the shutoff valves, then disconnect the gas line to the water heater. If you're old water heater pipe is damaged or not compatible with the new system, you will have to purchase new piping ($8-$10 per linear foot).</p>

<p>Probably the biggest disadvantage of traditional tank models is that you're limited by the amount of hot water the tank will hold. Here is where the tankless water heater comes in to play. The first thing homeowners want to check is whether there is water leaking from their hot water heater; and if it is a gas hot water heater, whether the pilot is lit. Tankless water heaters heat water on demand. Unheated water enters one side of the tank.</p>
<p>Let us install your tankless water heater and keep your plumbing running smoothly. Gas is fed to the burner through a gas control valve and thermostat switch that are usually located toward the bottom of the hot water storage tank.

<p>Gas water heaters will have a higher FHR compared to an electric heater with the same sized tank. It's estimated that gas water heaters last for up to 10 years and electric ones up to 15 ‚ but don't think you don't have to maintain and troubleshoot certain things about your hot water heater to meet, or even exceed, these projected lifetimes. The installation process is more time-consuming, and fewer plumbers know how to install them correctly.</p>
<p>Our installation process is fast and we can be out the same day you call with a new hot water tank heater. Tankless water heaters have become more popular because of their benefits. These only allow you hot water from one outlet at a time. Tankless water heaters are manufactured with energy-efficiency feature as a priority. Since tankless water heaters work by heating water from the external source on-demand, you could take a shower for 10 hours (or longer), and the water would be as hot as it would be for a 10-minute shower.</p>
