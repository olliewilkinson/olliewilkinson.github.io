<h2>Water Heater Services Tuskegee Alabama</h2>
<p>Water Heaters are a necessary household appliance that supplies all of your warm water needs, from cooking to bathing. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more often. We also want enough hot water for our needs and energy costs savings. Many people don't know much about water heaters or water heater repairs. A well-maintained tankless water heater can last for a long time. Typical anticipated lifetimes for these water heaters are 8-12 years for conventional and 10-15 years for high-efficiency.</p>
<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work. The age is also going to be affected by how much this water heater is used, as more wear and tear can cause the product to age faster. Old hot water heaters have parts that are worn. Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>
<p>Due to their small size, tankless hot water heaters can be installed on most flush wall surfaces, as long as they have access to fuel and water lines (which should already be taken care of). A point-of-use (POU) electric tankless water heater should not be a problem in terms of amperage requirements. VIP Plumbing's team is ready to provide the service, repair or replace your existing boiler with a high-efficiency system from Navien or Weil-Mclain to improve your Solon home comfort and lower your utility and fuel costs.</p>

<p>Tankless water heaters are still unusual in the U.S., where tank-type water heaters have been used for many years. Although a second unit might seem like a large investment, it can actually save you money in the long run since you'll use less water while waiting for hot water to arrive and less gas to heat the water. A tankless gas water heater needs a gas line to the water heater, and the unit must be vented to the outside.</p>
<p>Scalding water is usually the result of a damaged pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. What it means for you is that using a tankless electric heater you will never run out of hot water while in the shower.

If you aren't comfortable working with gas or electricity, do yourself a favor and call a professional plumber.</p>
