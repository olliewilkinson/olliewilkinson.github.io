<h2>Water Heater Services Covington Georgia</h2>
<p>When choosing a tankless water heater to go with, you have to first decide between tankless electric water heaters and tankless gas water heaters. Missing and improperly installed T&P discharge pipes are a common problem. Before you disconnect and remove your existing water heater, be sure to do all of the necessary preparation—you don't want to be stuck without hot water for a week or two while you're waiting for needed plumbing, electrical, or vent work.

<p>The tankless hot water heater will heat the water as it goes through the heat exchanger, which is activated by the incoming water as it flows through. Gas water heaters require gas lines that provide fuel to the ignition system and burner. If you are not experienced in maintaining a water heater, it is best to bring in a plumber to maintain it annually. Your perfect water heater will differ depending on your hot water expectations, your budget, and the layout of your home.</p>
<p>A local plumbing company such as Atlas Home Services eliminates the guesswork—and the hassle—around replacing your old water heater. By some estimates, a tankless hot water heater uses 22% less energy than its traditional counterpart. Whether you are in of water heater repairs or you're interested in upgrading to a newer, more efficient tankless model, our expert plumbing technicians can help. Check the Energy Factor (EF) to see how efficient the unit is. A higher EF rating indicates better efficiency.</p>

<p>Check out the most common problems to determine if a water heater repair or replacement is right for you. Electric water heater: Turn off the circuit breaker on the water heater's circuit at the home's breaker box. Tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, produce hot water only when you need it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when used in homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water each day, according to They also last about double the amount of time as long as a tank water heater.</p>
<p>Tank-type water heaters store hot water so that it's available when needed. Whether you'd like an electric water heater, gas water heater, or an energy-efficient tankless water heater, our skilled plumbers can help with the selection and installation. Switch off the gas valve and turn off the electric supply to the heater at the circuit breaker — watch the pilot light go out to ensure no more gas remains.</p>
<p>These problems with old water heaters then prompted the creation of the tankless water heater. We will remove and take away your old system for your convenience, and your new tankless water heater is properly installed to adhere to local plumbing codes. No matter what you're looking for, we can help you source the right product and install it for you so you can start enjoying the hot water you need.

<p>The Lifetime Unit Replacement Limited Warranty is valid for as long as the original purchaser owns their home. This saves energy and equals a lower heating bill. The dip tube is responsible for bringing water into your water heater to be warmed up. When the dip tube cracks, it sends cold water with the outgoing hot water. For you to install a tankless gas water heater you need to have the capability to have gas pumped into your home.</p>
<p>On a gas unit, also shut off the gas and unplug the electrical supply or turn off the circuit breaker. This happens because several feet of pipes separate the faucet from the water heater, and the water cools as it sits unused in the pipes. Flow rate: Flow rate refers to how many gallons of hot water the unit can provide in a minute. We will help you choose a water heater that is more energy-efficient and one that will work for your specific water needs.</p>

Our experienced technicians are equipped and trained for electric water heater repair. When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution. Traditional water heaters work by heating and storing a set amount of water in a tank. Turning on hot water throughout the home activates the heater, even if the pilot light is not on, so you are able to check the pipes for leaks much more easily.</p>

Before you get a new water heater, you'll want to determine which system best matches your household's needs.</p>
<p>Some of the common geyser repairs that we encounter and fix are overheating of water, water not heating enough or not heating at all, rust colored water, automatic heating function not working, water dripping from geyser (leakage), etc. To install the water heater in its place, start by pre-screwing the 4 bolts from your fixing kit into the rods. This is not covered in the video, but you should always check that the water heater is not receiving any electricity after shutting it off at the circuit breaker.</p>
<p>You might also waste a lot of water because you'll have to wait for it to heat up when you turn the tap on. Only when it knows it's needed will a tankless water heaters start warming up the water. Because water heaters can leak and flood homes, it is vital to have your water heater examined as soon as you notice a problem. Other costs can add anywhere from $50 to $1,500 or more, including permit fees, expansion tanks and carpentry work.</p>
<p>When picking out a water heater, pay attention to the energy efficiency rating of the models you're considering. You'll get several significant benefits from hiring a professional with experience for your water heater installation rather than trying it yourself if you haven't connected a water heater before. They constantly heat water so hot water is consistently available. With a gas water heater, there could be many other issues, and many of these can be a huge problem that you are going to want to get checked out.</p>
