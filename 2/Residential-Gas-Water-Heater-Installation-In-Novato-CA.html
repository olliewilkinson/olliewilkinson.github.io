<p>When it's time to replace your old water heater, you'll want it done fast and at a fair price. Gas hot water heater installation (hot water heater system replacement) is NOT a DIY (do-it-yourself) project. There is no need to wait until your hot water heater breaks down or becomes inefficient.

If you're relatively inexperienced, a water heater installation is not the repair on which to hone your plumbing skills.</p>
