<p>The average cost for a tankless water heater installation is $1,985, or between $1,470-$2,510. Tankless water heaters produce an endless supply of hot water, take up less space, have a lower risk of leaking, are safer, and have a significantly longer lifespan on average. If you are running out of hot water too early, it may be time to upgrade and have a new water heater installed.

This happens because several feet of pipes separate the faucet from the water heater, and the water cools as it sits unused in the pipes. Flow rate: Flow rate refers to how many gallons of hot water the unit can provide in a minute. We will help you choose a water heater that is more energy-efficient and one that will work for your specific water needs.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are installed near the point of use, or place where the hot water is needed. A tank style heater stores a specific amount of water, keeping it heated at the temperature you choose, sending it along when you turn on the hot water faucet. If you have a gas power heater, you have to install it about eighteen inches off the ground. When considering a tankless water heating system, one major thing to look into is the kind of fuel you want to use for heating.</p>

<p>The gas tankless water heater installation cost would be in the $1200 to $3000 range if switching from electric to gas. The tankless unit also uses a PVC flue pipe, which can be installed when a standard chimney is either not available or not practical.
