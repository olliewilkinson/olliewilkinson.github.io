The first two problems are easy to rectify and do not necessarily indicate any need for heater replacement. Installing an eligible solar or electric heat pump water heater entitles you to STCs, which can be sold to registered agents or traded individually.

While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Mableton Georgia 30126</h3>
<p>Whether you need emergency repairs to your existing system, or are considering upgrading your hot water heater, we can help you understand the cost and energy saving benefits of the options available. Some models, known as single point units, install close to the water source and are fairly inexpensive to purchase and install. That varies with the location and design of the unit, quality of installation, maintenance schedule and water quality.</p>
<p>You can also use a tankless hot water system which effectively only heats the water that you need when you need it. This certifies that the water is not always heated multiple times inside the big tank. These layers make the tank use more energy to heat up, causing the unit to overheat and weaken. When this happens, the pressure inside your water heater will build up and an explosion will occur. According to Home Depot, the chart below can help you determine how big of a tank water heater you need for your household.</p>
<p>So, if your current tank is larger than 55 gallons you will need to think about a new solution before it is time to replace your hot water heater. When using a conventional water heater, rust and scale build-up can collect in the interior of the storage tank. A power vent tankless water heater will function best when it is installed in an area with adequate airflow around it for combustion to take place. Before finding the right plumber, you should know everything that goes into the cost of repairing a hot water heater.</p>
<p>If line voltage not found and the tank is cool, replace lower thermostat. 6. Determine the last time you did maintenance on your water heater.
