<p>3. All tankless water heaters are pretty much the same. Electric units often require a 240 volt electric for the most efficiency. In less time than you would expect, hot water flows out ready to use just as if it came from a storage type heater. Your water heater works hard day and night to keep your family warm and comfortable from the time you wake up and take a shower, to the time you wash your face and get ready for a good nights sleep.</p>
<p>On a gas unit, also shut off the gas and unplug the electrical supply or turn off the circuit breaker. This happens because several feet of pipes separate the faucet from the water heater, and the water cools as it sits unused in the pipes. Flow rate: Flow rate refers to how many gallons of hot water the unit can provide in a minute. We will help you choose a water heater that is more energy-efficient and one that will work for your specific water needs.</p>

<p>But likewise, even though the problem may be similar, the repair solution is considerably different from a traditional tank heater. We'll consider whether you prefer gas or electric service, how much hot water your property demands, and how much available space you have for a new tank. Many a times, water heaters start with a slow leak at the base or around a corroded fitting, that is when you really need to get it checked.</p>
<p>Tankless water heating systems effectively cancels out the standby heat losses made by storage type heaters. However, in that 30 plus year span, it has been determined that tankless water heaters can be expected to last for 20 years or more with minimal care and maintenance being required. While these units will similarly fuel your system, the main differences occur in operating cost. Plumbers are pros at fitting pipes and stopping leaks, but that doesn't mean they can troubleshoot electrical problems, adjust gas pressures, or monitor combustion safety.</p>
<p>It's important to get a large enough tankless water heater to make sure that adequate hot water flow is available. If you use a lot of hot water, around 86 gallons per day, tankless water heaters are only 8% to 14% more efficient since they are running more often. Water Heaters Only Inc has been specializing in water heater replacement since 1968. Slide the new water heater into place, recut or extend the old tubing to meet the new, and solder the tubing together using copper slip couplings.</p>
<p>More expensive low-density elements are usually folded back like the one shown in Photo 5. These provide the same amount of heat but spread out over a larger surface area, which lowers the surface temperature, making them less prone to mineral buildup. Keep a distance of 24″ between the combustibles, the water heater, and the output hot water pipe. Colder climates mean colder incoming groundwater temperature, resulting in a need for more energy to heat the water to your desired temperature.</p>
<p>Use channel-type pliers or a pipe wrench to loosen and disconnect the lines from the water heater. Over time, water heaters often suffer from sediment build-up that can damage the tank. For example, a sudden loss of hot water may mean that the pilot has gone out. Be sure to connect the cold water pipe to the cold water inlet on the water heater. Cold water enters the tank and is heated by an electric element or gas burner.</p>
