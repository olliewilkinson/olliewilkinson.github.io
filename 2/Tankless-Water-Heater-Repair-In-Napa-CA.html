<h2>Water Heater Services Napa California</h2>
<p>Like any other things on the world, a hot water heater tank has its own parts. If a hot water faucet is turned on (such as if you take a shower), the water goes through a heat exchanger as it does so, meaning that this type of tankless water heater provides "on-demand" hot water without using a tank; this is something like an "on-demand" heater, but the boiler or furnace in a home heats the water directly, which means that the tankless coil water heater works best during the cold months when a home's heating system is on all or most of the time.</p>
