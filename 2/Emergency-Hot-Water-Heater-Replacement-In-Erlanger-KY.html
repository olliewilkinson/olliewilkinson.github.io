Solar water heaters use a storage tank that stores water heated by the sun. Haven Heating and Air Conditioning is your local tankless water heater repair specialist, get in touch with us today. It's these two things: Flow Rate and Gallons Per Minute that determine what size heater you need and whether it should be gas or electric. There are several factors that can affect your water heater. Whether it's installation of a brand new tank or tankless, repair of an existing tank or preventative and regular maintenance to ensure that your tank is operating at its maximum potential, the experts at AirPlus Heating & Cooling can handle it.
