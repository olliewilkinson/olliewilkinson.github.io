<h2>Water Heater Services Roselle Illinois</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>The innovative changes in gas valve function to heater designs alone are unequaled. We recommend talking to a licensed professional before making the final decision on a water heater purchase. If your water heater is at least 10 years old, it may be time for an upgrade. For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time can stretch a tankless water heater to its limit. Energy savings, endless supply of hot water, low operating cost, reduced risk of power problems, space savings and durability, and safety and assurance are the other advantages.</p>
<p>You'll be more than pleased with the results of a Show Plumbing tankless water heater installation, and you'll enjoy the system's benefits for years to come. The best heaters are those that have the best amount of insulation built into them. Permits are required on most water heater installs and pricing varies by province, city and municipality. Wait a few minutes to see if the water heater burner ignites. Or if your water heater is slow to heat or runs out of hot water faster than it used to, you may be able to make a quick fix by replacing the heating element.</p>
