<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement Moncks Corner</h3>
<p>It is also a good idea to check the anode when you flush the heater, if you make this a routine you will be able to replace the anode before it is completely gone. Also, because they are not heating 40 - 50 gallons of water 24 hours a day, tankless water heaters are less susceptible to leakage than tank-type water heaters. Homeowners believing they now had cheap hot water tended to use a lot more water than before the solar heaters were installed.</p>
<p>The cost difference between a traditional water heater and a tankless water heater usually shows the tankless option for a whole house water heater being 2 to 3 times more expensive. Our water heater team offers all water heater services, including 24-hour emergency repairs and replacements. Defective water can heaters consume a lot of gas and electricity, so you'll save quite a bit of cash by upgrading to an Energy Star-qualified model.</p>

<p>Please follow all plumbing and electrical codes when sourcing and installing parts for your new water heater. Whether you're running out of hot water on a daily basis, struggling with high energy costs, or worried about deterioration, you may be looking for a change. The actual zone in which the water heater is installed doesn't matter. Tankless water heaters are also supposed to be drained and the filters cleaned every month.</p>
<p>If your water heater is in a location that will cause damage to your home, you should strongly consider replacing it after 10 years (or before, if any of the following symptoms occur). With a gas heater turn the thermostat knob to the pilot setting. Tankless heaters provide continuous hot water, so gone are the days of the hot water running out mid-shower. Inadequate Water Flow: Another thing to be aware of is that if minerals build up in the tankless water heater, they can cause slow water flow from faucets and taps.</p>
<p>Sometimes, your water heater will give you signs that it's struggling before it dies. Installing the temperature controls can be tricky if you aren't familiar with them, so make sure you read the instructions regarding this part of installation as well.

Regular maintenance also extends the life of your water heater.</p>
<p>Save money, improve efficiency of your heating system with our professional water heater and tankless water heater installation and repair services. They do require a storage tank, unlike conventional tankless water heaters, but because an indirect heater uses the boiler or main furnace to heat the fluid circulated through a heat exchanger in the storage tank, the energy that's actually "stored" by the tank lets the furnace turn off and on less frequently.</p>
<p>Overall, there are situations where a hot water tank is a better choice over a tankless water heater. Vents also need to be installed to ventilate the unit. Low maintenance: With no storage tank to drain, clean, and protect from corrosion, tankless water heaters require less maintenance, and may last longer than traditional storage-tank water heating equipment. Tankless water heater built with condensing technology has lower costs of installation.</p>
<p>It's much more convenient to shop for a replacement water heater around the 10-year or 15-year mark, depending on what type of water heater you have. No need to worry, give us a call right away and we can find the solution to any of your issues with your water heater. Speaking of, you should absolutely have your new tankless water heater installed by a professional. Low water pressure is a typical problem with tankless water heaters and is usually caused by running too many hot water appliances at one time.</p>
<p>Electric tankless hot water installation can similarly run into a variety of problems if it is not wired by professionals. A tankless water heater is a system of heating your household water that doesn't require the standard water tank of a traditional system. Your water heater is one of the most important parts of your home. Heater Size: If your unit is too small, it will not be able to heat water efficiently.</p>
