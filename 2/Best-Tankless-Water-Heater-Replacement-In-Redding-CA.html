<p>When you rely on Roto-Rooter for water heater repair , maintenance or replacement, you can expect professional service from skilled plumbing experts. It's also advantageous to preemptively upgrade an obsolete water heater to a new model that's more reliable and efficient. Terrano Plumbing and Remodeling proudly endorse Noritz Gas Tankless water heaters as the #1 gas tankless in the industry for residential and commercial applications.

<p>During the course of an average home occupancy, a resident is bound to face that moment where they need to replace a water heater. Traditional tank water heaters can become rusted or corroded over time. They constantly heat water so hot water is consistently prepared.

Gas heaters are touted as being more economical and environmentally friendly than electric, but they also have more components that may wear out or fail.</p>

Tankless gas water heaters have wider applications, as they supply hot water at higher flow rates. And keep in mind that because of recent federal energy regulations, a replacement storage tank may take up more space than your old one, even if it's the same capacity, because newer ones are required to have more insulation.</p>

The tankless water heating system seems to be the best option as it significantly saves time and energy. Like our other services, your new water heater will be covered by our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee for a year. This heat from the pilot flame causes a tiny electrical signal to be sent to the control valve, telling the control valve that there is a flame present so it's OK to let the gas through to the main burner when the thermostat calls for heat.</p>

Higher installation cost: The upfront cost to install a new tankless water heater is more than a conventional storage tank system. These units, which heat water with thick copper rods, are quieter and about a third smaller than gas or propane tankless heaters.
