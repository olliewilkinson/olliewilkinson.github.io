<h2>Water Heater Services Cedar Bluff Virginia</h2>
<p>It's hard to believe it, but over 19,000 water heaters are replaced every day. Most conventional natural-draft water heaters vent exhaust completely different than any tankless water heater, and though they are a fuel burning appliance, they do need power to operate. Many thermostats have a reset button which can sometimes be pushed to reset the circuit and get the water heater working again. Once we've discussed your viable options and you've made a selection, our technicians can carefully remove your old water heater and safely install your new one.</p>
<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call.

If the water heater liner corrodes, the unit can start leaking—and if the drain pan under the water heater is old or incorrectly installed, you may end up with water damage to your floors, ceilings or wall, depending on the location of your appliance.</p>
<p>Once you have placed the new water heater in the compartment, installed your hot and cold connections, connected your gas supply line, and connected the pressure relief line, you are ready to fill the tank. Your water heater works silently around the clock to give you a constant supply of warm water. Look out for the energy factor (EF) too, as this indicates how well the unit can converts its fuel to heat. Water quality is an important consideration for all water equipment, and water heaters will often be impacted the most.</p>
