<h2>Water Heater Services Jennings Louisiana</h2>
<p>When choosing a tankless water heater to go with, you have to first decide between tankless electric water heaters and tankless gas water heaters. Missing and improperly installed T&P discharge pipes are a common problem. Before you disconnect and remove your existing water heater, be sure to do all of the necessary preparation—you don't want to be stuck without hot water for a week or two while you're waiting for needed plumbing, electrical, or vent work. While the water is draining out of the old heater, Unbox the new water heater.

Traditional water heaters are constantly warming water throughout the day, even when you're not using it. Tankless units only heat what you need, efficiently, helping you save on costs. Most tankless water heaters burn either natural gas or propane fuel.</p>
<p>If LPG gas installation is required, including gas bottle installation, LPG installation cost would be in the $250 to $500 range, depending on the lengths of the pipe runs. The energy efficiency of the boiler or hot water tank storage system comes from the dual use, which reduces standing water heat loss and offsets electric energy use with natural gas. We perform all the water heater services you need, from installing a high-efficiency unit to keeping the appliance up and running for years to come.</p>
<h3>Local Hot Water Heater Repair Jennings</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters have several advantages over traditional tank-style water heaters.

<p>While scale can shorten the life of the heating element, you don't need to invest in fancy features to get a water heater that lasts. Tankless heaters can be installed underneath sinks or in small closets as well as in traditional hot water tank enclosures.
