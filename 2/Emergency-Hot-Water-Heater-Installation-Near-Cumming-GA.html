<h2>Water Heater Services Cumming Georgia</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>If you currently have a gas system then purchase a tankless water heater system that also operates on gas. Plumbing-supply stores, big-box stores, and online retailers all carry these heaters. By periodically draining the water heater tank and having a thorough rinse performed by our professionals, you'll be able to keep mineral buildup to a minimum. Consequently, the lack of maintenance plays a big role in repair costs and necessity.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>
