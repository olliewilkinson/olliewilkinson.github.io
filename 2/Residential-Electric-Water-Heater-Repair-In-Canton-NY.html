<p>Using a heating element, either electric or gas-powered, water passes into the unit and is immediately warmed to a set temperature. You will soon hear banging or rumbling sounds from your heater due to the obstruction inside the tank. New home construction is the best time to think about energy saving appliances like tankless hot water heaters, especially for gas heaters that require more home modification.</p>
<p>With a tank-style hot water heater, water is heated in a tank and stored until it is needed. Electric water heaters are powered by standard electricity to heat and cool the water that flows to your tubs, showers, sinks, dishwasher, and washing machine. Because tankless heaters do not store water, they are less subject to corrosion than tank-type heaters. All Pro Plumbing, Heating, Air & Electrical has all your water heater services covered.</p>

<p>Problems such as rusty or discolored water, strange noises or low or no heat are also indicators it's time to get your water heater repaired or replaced. A tankless water heater is also called an "on-demand" water heater, because it only heats water when you turn on the hot water tap. Tankless water heaters take up very little space because they have no capacity to store water; instead, cold water is piped through a heat exchanger and heated to a preset temperature range.</p>
<p>If this is impossible and only a single unit can be installed, you will discover that it can not give hot water for multiple units. Usually, when a hot water heater gives out, owners are forced to make a split-second decision to make sure that residents get their hot water back ASAP. Our expert team of plumbers, electricians, heating repair technicians, AC repair technicians, and system design managers performs top-quality repairs and installations while ensuring you are completely satisfied with your entire customer service.</p>
