With reduced energy usage, reduced water consumption, less sewage, and an on demand system, tankless water heaters are a green alternative to hot water tanks.

<p>Whether you are doing multiple loads of laundry or using the shower multiple times a day, a tankless water heater means you'll constantly be provided with the hot water your household needs. Present day water heaters are constructed to require little to no maintenance, but many issues can be avoided with regular check-ups. In most cases, a plumber will install a water heater in a day (6-8 hours). A lot of homeowners choose a tank-type water heater - a large, cylindrical tank standing on end with pipes attached to it.</p>
<p>You can install a standalone heat pump water heater or combine your water heater with your heating and cooling system, employing an air or ground source heat pump. Reverse the tank orientation so that water pipes do not travel over or near the electrical wiring. This will vary by location and complexity of the hot water system installation, so it pays to get about 3 quotes. With energy costs on the rise, it may be time for you to consider switching to tankless.</p>

SoCo Heating and Cooling technicians know what to look for to see if your water heater repair is something simple, such as a thermostat adjustment or replacement, or something more serious like failed burners or calrods.

If you're looking to save on energy costs and would like hot water on demand, consider a tankless water heater. First turn off the power to the water heater at your main electrical panel. Traditional heaters often require replacement at the first sign of failure.</p>
<p>Exterior tankless water heaters, can be installed on an exterior wall to have no impact to the space or appearance on the interior of the home. These will heat your water in different ways, either with electrical coils or natural gas. Tankless heaters are about the size of a medicine cabinet. Our expert and knowledgeable professionals are trained to work on all varieties of water heaters, whether gas, electric, or heat pump water heaters.</p>
<p>These systems are also sometimes called on-demand water heaters because they only heat water when there is an immediate need for it. So there is no energy being wasted to maintain a tank of hot water that might not be used for hours, days, or even weeks if you are not at home. On the positive side, and despite the sticker-shock price tag, a tankless heater may be the best solution in a remote or infrequently used location.</p>

For those who have already bought the product, tankless water heater reviews can help in locating dealers regarding service details and provide directions in case repairs are needed.</p>

The installation of a gas nozzle and the gas itself needs to be completed through a trained professional who has the experience and knows what they are doing.</p>
<p>Low Capacity: The water heater that was originally installed in your home was not designed to keep up with a growing family and modern appliances. Many newer water heaters use a new electronic control valve called the Honeywell Smart Controller. Consumer Reports recently tested four electric and five gas whole-house tankless water heaters from such brands as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless to see how costs, performance, and energy use stack up against that of conventional storage tank water heaters.</p>
<p>Depending on the service load of your home, you may need an electrician to install a larger breaker to provide you with enough power. Most tank-style water heaters won't live past 20 years. Press the probe tips against the terminals of the heating element (one probe to each screw). Energy efficiency of your water heater can be improved through its correct installation and maintenance. A bonus: Without all that gunk inside, your water heater will operate more efficiently, saving you money.</p>
