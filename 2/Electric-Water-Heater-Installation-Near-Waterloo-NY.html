<p>So, when your water heater stops working, you need professional help—fast. Once the union is disconnected disconnect the rest of the pipe ONLY on the heater you are replacing. The cost of a space heating water heating combination unit is higher than that of a separate heater and furnace. This requires the services of a qualified commercial plumber who can respond to problems or concerns quickly and professionally.</p>
<p>Most modern tankless water heaters operate in the range of 11,000 to 199,000 BTUs per hour. If you're planning to sell your home in the near future, and you fear your existing water heater may not last, I would consider the lower upfront cost of a conventional one, or at most upgrade (for the improved marketability) to the high-efficiency gas storage water heater, rather than incurring the additional expense of a whole-home tankless gas water heater.</p>
<p>Removal of current system: another issue to consider is that the removal and disposal costs of your current water heater, which can be upwards of $500 dollars, based on your area. Gas water heaters use a gas powered pilot light to heat the water that you enjoy in your home.

This cuts down on the wait time for hot water, provides you with a limitless supply, and allows for the whole family to gain access to hot water without waiting for your tank to refill. A typical tankless water heater installation can take a crew of 2 technicians an average of 6-10 hours, depending on installation requirements.</p>
<p>Let's say you have 3 water fixtures close together and have determined that one tankless system will be purchased for serving these fixtures. Higher installation cost: The upfront cost to install a new tankless water heater is more than a conventional storage tank system. These units, which heat water with thick copper rods, are quieter and about a third smaller than gas or propane tankless heaters. Compared with a tank-type heater costing $400 or so, a $1,000 tankless gas heater may save a household only about $100 per year, depending on how efficient it is and how much hot water is used.</p>
<p>Water consumption (amount of hot water to be used) is another important factor in determining which heating system to purchase. Denver water is quite cold, which creates condensation on the walls of hot water storage tanks. Electric water heaters use, you guessed it- electricity, to heat the water.
