<h2>Water Heater Services North Palm Beach Florida</h2>
<p>Various devices at home allow us to live and move comfortably. It also means that you should never run out” of hot water, because it is continually heated for as long as you leave hot water running. Electric tankless water heaters are quickly growing in popularity given their potential energy savings and ability to deliver hot water on demand. Interior tankless heaters need to bring in air from the outside, and there are two different methods to accomplish this: power vent and direct vent.</p>
<p>If the water heater is located in an attic, water damage can result in every ceiling and floor beneath the water heater. Your water requirements will also have to be considered when choosing a tankless water heater. Our GoHot tankless heater is only the size of a briefcase. Since we are talking about electric tankless, the only thing I will say about gas models is that they almost always have better performance than electric models.</p>
<p>This problem is only compounded as sediment build up in the tank over time and reduces the amount of hot water the tank can store. In the case of installing electric tankless water heaters you may be required to have an electrician upgrade the electrical service to your home or plug, depending on its age and set up. We have a wide variety of gas and electric tank water heaters available in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>
<h3>Local Tankless Water Heater Repair North Palm Beach</h3>
<p>If your family has grown larger or smaller, this is a good time to consider upsizing or downsizing your water heater. A traditional water heater stores hot water in a large tank. You'll need to have the water heater cleaned out, but we also strongly recommend installing a water softener to eliminate the problem at the source. With tankless electric water heaters, there is a direct relationship between the flow rate of a fixture (demand), the power supplied to the tankless electric water heater, and the output temperature of the hot water.</p>
<p>They can cut your water heating bills in half and earn you a nice utility rebate from Duke Energy. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day. Because they use up to 30 to 50 percent less energy, tankless units can save an average family about $100 or more annually, depending on water usage. Regular maintenance is required for a longer life of a water heater.</p>
<p>Warranties can be voided by installing without licensed plumbers, installing the heater in the bathroom, not doing annual maintenance. We are experts when it comes to repairing water heaters and if necessary, helping you lay out your options for water heater replacement. If you're fortunate enough to live someplace sunny most of the year around, a solar powered water heater may be an option for you.

<p>When it comes to water heater repair and replacement in Houston, we take the time to examine the issue, communicate, and determine the best solutions for your home and your needs. If there's a problem with the heater's thermocouple, the problem is critical because it's actually a safety instrument that detects when the pilot light is on. If the pilot isn't lit the gas valve won't turn the gas on. When a hot water tap is turned on, water enters the tankless water heater.</p>

During the storage of the hot water in the tank, a lot of energy is wasted to keep the water at temperature even if nobody uses it for days since it needs to be heated all the time or it'll become colder by the minute, and these electricity expenses all add up quite quickly to the water bill.</p>
