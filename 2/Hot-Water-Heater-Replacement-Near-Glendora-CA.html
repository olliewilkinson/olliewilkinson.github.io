<p>But likewise, even though the problem may be similar, the repair solution is considerably different from a traditional tank heater. We'll consider whether you prefer gas or electric service, how much hot water your property demands, and how much available space you have for a new tank. Many a times, water heaters start with a slow leak at the base or around a corroded fitting, that is when you really need to get it checked.</p>
<p>That means performing the manufacturer's recommended preventive water heater maintenance , periodically draining the tank (or lines) to remove damaging sediment and scale. Tank-type natural gas hot water heaters use ½” gas lines, while tankless hot water heaters require ¾” gas lines.

Age: As a rule, if your water heater is more than ten years old, it's time to invest in a new water heater. As soon you turn off the water flow, the heater turns off. The traditional water heater keeps water hot 24 hours a day even you are at work or sleeping. Most tank-style water heaters last about eight to 12 years.</p>
