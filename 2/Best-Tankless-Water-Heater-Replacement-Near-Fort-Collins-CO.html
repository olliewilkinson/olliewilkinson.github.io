<h2>Water Heater Services Fort Collins Colorado</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work. The age is also going to be affected by how much this water heater is used, as more wear and tear can cause the product to age faster. Old hot water heaters have parts that are worn. Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so.
