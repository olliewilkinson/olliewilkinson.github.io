<p>And don't miss out on our special offers on water heaters. Depending on your home and hot water demand, you may need to install a whole-home system one (or more) point-of-use units. This type of system absorbs heat from surrounding air and deposits it inside the water, achieving more than double the efficiency of standard water heating. When you're looking to replace your water heater, there is nothing more frustrating than chasing down contractors, wondering if they will show up, and being charged more than you had been led to believe.</p>
<p>For instance, for a home with two stories and a basement, the worst place to install the heater is in the basement. However if you find that you have no hot water with an electric tank it would be a good idea to check your breaker to see if the breaker has tripped. A broken or deteriorated dip tube can cause the cold water to stay near the top, making your water heater unable to heat the water properly. There are a lot of reasons why a homeowner or business owner might choose to upgrade to a new water heater, with some of them ranging from the size to the water heater's ability to heat up water.</p>
<p>Using a traditional circulating pump will void the warranty on most tankless heaters, since they will cause the heater to turn on and off very frequently and far more than in typical household usage. If you know you have a recirculating loop for you water heater, it is a good idea to have a ball valve before the point where the loop connects to you water heater. Installing a tankless hot water heater while a new home is under construction makes good sense, especially for gas units that require more to make them operational.</p>
<p>If your water heater is in a location that will not cause damage if there is a leak, you can wait until it develops a leak before replacing it, but that really is not recommended. The amount you pay for service goes towards your replacement. In addition, we are trained to repair and install commercial tankless water heater and commercial water heater systems. Luckily, hot water heaters are fairly simple and don't have a lot of moving parts.</p>
<p>If you do opt for a whole house tankless heater then get yourself a hot water demand system. If your water heater has an EF of at least 0.82, you can qualify for federal tax credit. Incorrect installations can shave years off your water heater, can significantly reduce its performance, and can expose you to unsafe conditions. These small systems can be installed easily and provide you with pinpoint temperature accuracy for all your water heating needs.</p>
