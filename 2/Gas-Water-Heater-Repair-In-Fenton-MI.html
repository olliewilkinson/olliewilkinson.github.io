<p>You can't just walk into your local home center and pick the cheapest water heater from the display. Kenmore makes gas and electric water heaters. Residential water heater repair is our most common type of job, so you can rest assured that all our technicians are experts at such repairs. The first kind works similarly to the hot rod in that an electric heating element heats the water. This then makes textiles, cloths, papers, and wood into potential fire hazards if left carelessly near the heating element of the heater.</p>
<p>If you have a warranty of 12 to 15 years, which is typical, it doesn't make financial sense to replace a tank water heater with a tankless,” says Banta. Often an emergency, like a leaking water tank, is the reason a water heater is replaced. The Service Company Plumbing & Drains team is experienced in handling all types of water heater repair or replacement issues and can often have your hot water heater repaired or a new water heater installation completed same day in most cases.</p>
<p>Direct vent heaters are slightly higher in efficiency over standard water heaters but are significantly less efficient than tankless water heaters. The statistical life expectancy of a storage tank water heater is 10-12 years, depending on care and maintenance. For those suffering from a leaky water heater, John Moore can even repair your water damaged walls and floors without the headache of dealing with multiple contractors.</p>

<p>We'll take a look at some potential water heater malfunctions below. However, tankless varieties are known to last longer than conventional water heater models which translates to a 20+-year useful life, as compared to storage tank types which last only 10 to 15 years before falling apart due to corrosion or part failure of some sort. Depending on where you have the water heater located inside your house, a leak could result in significant property damage.</p>
<p>They can cut your water heating bills in half and earn you a nice utility rebate from Duke Energy. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day. Because they use up to 30 to 50 percent less energy, tankless units can save an average family about $100 or more annually, depending on water usage. Regular maintenance is required for a longer life of a water heater.</p>
<p>Touch red probe to the power screw terminal of heating element and black probe to the power screw terminal of thermostat. If these stops don't lead to hot water, it's time to either check the heating element in an electric water heater or the burner unit and gas control valve in a gas-powered heater. Mechanical Systems Expertise: To install and service water heaters, mechanical systems know-how is a must. We paid $570 (electric) and $600 (gas) for the two 50-gallon Rheem tank water heaters we tested, but we have seen tank water heaters priced for less at home improvement stores.</p>
<p>Metro Plumbing, Heating and Air also provides businesses in the Chattanooga, TN, Cleveland, TN and N. Georgia area with preventive care solutions. Your water heater is making strange or loud noises: Any loud popping or cracking sounds could signal an issue with your water heater.

Storage tank water heaters last an average of 10-15 years, while tankless water heaters may last 20 years or more before suffering in performance due to age. While most homes will have traditional tanked units, tankless water heater systems are quickly gaining popularity, and for good reason. Compared to the 7.5 to 9.5 gallons per minute that storage tanks can pump out, tankless units average flow rates between 2.5 and 5 gallons per minute.</p>
<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>It may be difficult to figure out what's wrong with your hot water heater on your own, so instead, make an appointment with Timothy Off. We provide a range of system types, brands, and sizes, including tank, tankless, hybrid, heat pump, and solar water heaters. With a tank heater, the element is usually the first thing that goes out, usually well before the tank itself does. This reduces damage to the tank caused by overheating.</p>
<p>If you're continually running out of hot water mid-shower, then chances are your unit is not properly sized for the needs of your home. For a traditional water heater with a tank, the process involves removal, installation, and setup. If you need water heater repair or installation services in the metro Atlanta area and surrounding cities throughout Georgia, Assured Comfort Heating, Air, Plumbing is ready to help serve your needs.</p>
