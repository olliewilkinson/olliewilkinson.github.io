Once the water in the top part of the tank has reached the temperature value determined by the top thermostat setting, the top thermostat (is considered "satisfied") switches power from the top element to the lower thermostat. We can help guide you through these and help you choose the hot water heater that will best match your needs for hot water output while maximizing the efficiency of the utility source from which it runs.</p>
