<h2>Water Heater Services Green Bay Wisconsin</h2>
<p>A gas hot water heater is the most common type you will find in most households. The best way to prevent emergency water heater repairs is to schedule regular maintenance for your system. Long lasting - Traditional tank water heating systems generally come with a warranty of up to 6 years. Here, the water is heated using either a gas burner or electric element as it passes through. If you've had enough of waiting for your water tank to heat the water, there is the option of a tankless water heater.</p>

<p>But because these tankless gas units last longer, the savings kicks in after six years, about when many tanks are nearing their demise. Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger delivering it directly to your faucets or shower without using a storage tank. Whether you're in central Austin, or a surrounding city such as Lakeway, Bee Caves, Round Rock, Westlake Hills or Georgetown, TX, there is always potential for your water heater to experience one of these issues.</p>

<p>A 50 gallon water heater can take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours for electric or 30 to 60 minutes for gas to heat water to 120 degrees. It really depends on the brand you buy, and the cost of the model purchased, but a traditional water heater will last 10 to 13 years, and a tankless water heater will generally last up to 20 years. If the circuit breaker or fuse repeatedly blows out, call a qualified electrician to check and repair the circuit.</p>
<p>For residential applications, the hot water set point temperature should be only slightly above the highest temperature needed for domestic uses. A lot of times when this happens, its because the necessary repairs and maintenance were not scheduled for your water heater. Since the issue just started after you installed the tankless water heater, I would highly recommend calling the water heater company and asking them to come to take a look.</p>
