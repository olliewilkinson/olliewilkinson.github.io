<h3>Emergency Hot Water Heater Installation Monroeville</h3>
<p>Admittedly, your old water heater is one of the biggest contributors to that high energy bill, and replacing it could mean considerable savings. Tankless water heaters have become increasingly popular due to their efficiency and compact size. Several smaller units cannot produce enough hot water for simultaneous purposes in large families. As many homeowners look for ways to lower their energy costs, one area of improvement is water heating.</p>
<p>Water underneath the water heater is almost always a sure sign that your water heater needs replacing. Raise the gas burner or the lower heating element on an electric water heater at least eighteen inches above the floor if the equipment is in the garage. In large homes however, you might need more than one for a proper supply of hot water. Generally residential water heaters have a life expectancy of 8-12 years.</p>

Because of the high heat of the exhaust gasses and their corrosive condensate, interior installations require expensive sealed stainless steel venting systems.</p>
<h3>An Easy Approach To Find A Reliable Plumber Monroeville AL</h3>
<p>A 50 gallon water heater can take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours for electric or 30 to 60 minutes for gas to heat water to 120 degrees. It really depends on the brand you buy, and the cost of the model purchased, but a traditional water heater will last 10 to 13 years, and a tankless water heater will generally last up to 20 years. If the circuit breaker or fuse repeatedly blows out, call a qualified electrician to check and repair the circuit.</p>
<p>When the demand for water ceases, the unit shuts down and uses no energy, a revolutionary advantage over a standard water heater. Deciding which water heater offers the best value comes down to a number of factors, such as fuel source, efficiency, water usage, and size. A 100-gallon storage tank is going to take up a lot of room, and buying a water heater that is too large can cause all sorts of problems. The benefit of tankless water heaters in that scenario is that your whole family can take showers back-to-back without worrying about running out of hot water.</p>
<p>Lower temperatures have also been proven to make your tankless gas water heater last longer because less minerals and corrosion will build up. Consider insulating your water heater pipes as well, especially if the water is traveling three feet or more from the unit's location. The approach is consistent for tankless water heaters. Many manufacturer's and plumbers recommend that a water softener is installed when you have a tankless water heater.</p>

Upper thermostat may have failed and requires replacement or heating element may have failed and requires replacement.</p>
<p>If there is a similar problem with an electric tank-type water heater, no such explosion can occur. What it does is provide hot water on demand so you don't have to worry about the shower suddenly running cold. This water heater hangs on your wall and, instead of storing a large tank of water that is kept constantly hot-even when you're asleep or not at home-the tankless water heater produces hot water only when it's needed, as it's needed.</p>
<p>Size of Water Heater Needed. Clarke & Rush helps homeowners install newer tankless water heaters - which are way more efficient and provide hot water on demand. Before you being installing your tankless gas water heater, read through the owner's manual and the installation instructions. If the reset button has been tripped you should be able to hear and feel a definite click when you push it. If you think it was tripped, put everything back together, turn the power on and check for hot water in about an hour.</p>
<p>Now that know how to calculate the size tankless heater to fit your home what's left is to determine whether electric or natural gas is the best energy source. Your water heater may be old and inefficient, it may need repairing, or you may need a larger water heater or tankless model.
