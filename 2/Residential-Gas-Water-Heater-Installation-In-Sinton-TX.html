Plus you are not going to need to make sure that there is not unused hot water in your tankless water heater that would end up running the pipes in the long run.</p>
<p>These are not required for gas instant hot water systems. Electric water heaters are high-voltage (240-volt) appliances that are dangerous to work with when the power is on. Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box).
