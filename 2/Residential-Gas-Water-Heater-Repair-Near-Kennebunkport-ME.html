<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Kennebunkport ME</h3>
<p>Before you get a new water heater, you'll want to determine which system best meets your family's demands. Storage tank sizes are determined by the size and hot water requirements of the household it is to serve. The key is picking the most efficient water heater large enough to handle your needs. While a water heater replacement is needed on occasion, a lot of times homeowners and business owners don't know when a replacement is needed.</p>
<p>If you have the wrong pipe or electrical fittings you will have to return to the hardware store causing delays of the installation process. If you can and choose to do the job yourself, you should know how to shut off the water to your house (see How to Shut Off the Water to Fixtures ) and how to cut into and connect new fittings and pipes to your supply pipes (if you have copper pipes, see Cutting & Joining Copper Pipe ).</p>

<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there.

Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>
<p>The main advantage of using a tankless water heater system is that they eliminate the extra cost of keeping 40 to 50 gallons of water hot in a storage tank, so you waste less energy.
