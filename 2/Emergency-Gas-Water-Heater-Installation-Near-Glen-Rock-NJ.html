If you discover rusty water coming from your water heater and it only comes from the hot side piping in your home, this can be a sign that your water heater is rusting away on the inside and it may begin to leak soon.</p>

Efficiency: If your water heater is of an older make and model, upgrading to a new, energy-efficient appliance will pay for itself over time.

Your water heater works silently around the clock to give you a constant supply of warm water.
