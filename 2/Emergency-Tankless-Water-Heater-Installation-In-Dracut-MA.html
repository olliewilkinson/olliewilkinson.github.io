<h2>Water Heater Services Dracut Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>Other water heater brands currently on the market include: Bradford White, EcoSmart, Rinnai, and State. All you need to do to receive a continuous, consistent supply of hot water is turn the unit on” by just opening the hot water faucet. Showering immediately after running the dishwasher is also out because this activity uses up a lot of hot water and drains the tank significantly. We can come to your house, inspect your water heater, and help you determine the best replacement timeline and option.</p>
<p>Many of the more popular manufacturers such as Bosch, Rheem and Rinnai produce tankless water heaters which use natural gas. This relates to the purchase of a new water heater by providing the purchaser with significant tax credits when purchasing a tankless unit. Unlike other manufacturers, Noritz does not outsource the main components of their heaters.

<p>Low Capacity: The water heater that was originally installed in your home was not designed to keep up with a growing family and modern appliances. Many newer water heaters use a new electronic control valve called the Honeywell Smart Controller. Consumer Reports recently tested four electric and five gas whole-house tankless water heaters from such brands as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless to see how costs, performance, and energy use stack up against that of conventional storage tank water heaters.</p>
<p>While you'll usually pay a bit more for longer-warranty models, we've found that they tend to have larger elements or burners that can speed up water heating and have thicker insulation for less heat loss. To prevent this pressure from building up, every water heater uses a relief valve in its construction. Homeowners often ask if a gas water heater or an electric unit is more cost-efficient.
