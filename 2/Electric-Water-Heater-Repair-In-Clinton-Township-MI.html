<h2>Water Heater Services Clinton Township Michigan</h2>
<p>Water heater maintenance is one of the most important yet overlooked things home owners need to be aware of. Whether residing in a fairly new or older dwelling, it is very important that you inspect the appliance at regular intervals and make sure that it is working properly. You generally have to install a tank water heater indoors, as they cannot tolerate harsh weather conditions. There are several ways that you can benefit from having a tankless water heater installed. It should be noted that, for sizing purposes, the typical worst-case scenario (the middle of winter) should be assumed for the incoming groundwater temperature to ensure adequate hot-water availability year-round.</p>
<p>If you have a warranty of 12 to 15 years, which is typical, it doesn't make financial sense to replace a tank water heater with a tankless,” says Banta. Often an emergency, like a leaking water tank, is the reason a water heater is replaced. The Service Company Plumbing & Drains team is experienced in handling all types of water heater repair or replacement issues and can often have your hot water heater repaired or a new water heater installation completed same day in most cases.</p>
<p>I need to purchase a new water heater SOON. Energy Saving: You'll notice the difference in your electricity bill since you don't have to heat up an entire tank of water. Your water heater's size is determined by how much warm water you use and what kind of heater you select. Other terms for Tankless are Combination, Combi Boilers, Continuous Flow, Inline, Flash, On-Demand or Instant-On Water heaters. Tankless water systems are popular for the simple reasons that tankless systems provide you with a virtually endless supply of hot water both where and when you need it. With old style tank systems, heated water can sit for long periods of time, generating hard-water scale and using costly energy to maintain water temperatures.</p>
<h3>Affordable Tankless Water Heater Repair Clinton Township</h3>
<p>Your water heater will last a very long time with proper installation, service, and maintenance. Depending on the unit, this could mean both of your heating elements burned out or it could have a variety of other causes. It can be installed in an interior closet and replace that old tank type water heater. Every water heater manual ever written has a section regarding maintenance. There are many types of water heaters.</p>
<p>If the element has a short, power will flow through the metal tank of the water heater. The average life span of a water heater is between 8 and 12 years. Fill the water heater and check for leaks. Our licensed plumbing experts from Mr. Rooter® Plumbing can help you determine whether a tankless water heater is right for your home. The drain cock located at the bottom of the hot water storage tank is where you or a service technician can flush the tank.</p>
<p>January and November also seem to be good months to buy a water heater. Attach a new temperature and pressure relief valve to the heater. The electric tankless unit will only heat the water that you use and does not have the standby heat loss that typically comes with traditional tank-type products. If our water heater inspection determines that your unit has outlived its useful life or is damaged beyond economical repair, we may suggest a full water heater replacement.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, produce hot water only when you want it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when added to homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water each day, according to They also last about two times as long as a tank water heater. Most RV water heaters have either 6 gallon or 10 gallon tanks. If you have a tankless water heater, you will never find yourself in that scenario.</p>

It is an easy way to empty your water heater tank for maintenance. Tankless water heaters should last 5-10 years longer than tank models with proper maintenance. Venting for these units are more elaborate and controlled than with a conventional tank-type heater.</p>
<p>Thanks to the low emission of potentially health-threatening elements tankless water heaters are environment-friendly. If your current hot water heater cannot meet your needs, new water heater installation is likely the best choice. Higher installation cost - You might run into a higher installation cost because of venting requirements, as well as the placement of additional tankless units around the home. If your existing hot water heater is good, just requiring maintenance, minor repairs, or new fittings, we can get you working again in no time.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Clinton Township Michigan 48038</h3>
<p>The water storage tank works in a very simple way; at the top of the tank are two feed pipes, one for cold water the other for the hot water. Whether gas or electric, tankless water heaters heat water only as it is needed and may save up to 70 percent on a yearly heating bill. The tankless water heater heats the water when it is required. These traditional heaters can be exhausted and take a long time to refill and reheat.</p>
<p>Please contact a professional to fix and maintain your hot water heater. Turn off the water inlet and outlet valves on the water heater. When it comes down to powering the heating process, tankless water heaters use 30-50% less electricity than water storage tank models. When you need hot water, the tankless water heater draws cold water into the heater, circulates it around a heat exchanger, and sends it back out into your home's piping.</p>
<p>A water heater replacement from Canyon State includes a detailed property inspection that helps you find the right model at the right price. Most tankless units can provide up to 3.5 gallons of heated water per minute. Read this if you're not sure your water heater needs replacing. This could be a sign that your water heater is getting older and losing efficiency. If we determine that your water heater needs a replacement, we have two options for you.</p>
<p>As long as a large enough water heater is installed, it's not a problem. Depending on the age of your water heater, the repair may be simpler and more affordable than you think. This means you could pay for two tank heaters in the same time a single tankless model lasts. The cost to install a new water heater ranges from $400 to $900 for a 40 to 50-gallon tank, and between $1,470 and $2,510 for a tankless. If your existing unit has seen better days, a water heater replacement is often the best course of action.</p>
<p>We'll update you about your water heater repair appointment via text, email or phone-whichever you prefer. Homes without a gas line or propane tank can also enjoy the advantages of on-demand hot water by installing tankless units powered by electricity. Again, this is no longer a tankless water heater, however.
