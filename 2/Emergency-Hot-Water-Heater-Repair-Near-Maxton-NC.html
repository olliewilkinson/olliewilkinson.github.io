Considerations with this type of installation include the size of the system, since the combination system is going to be calculated for size differently than if you're installing separate space and water heating systems.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that Tankless water heaters require less energy, but they also are money to purchase and install. Clean where you're new tank will sit since you won't have access to this spot again for some time and once the new tank goes in, it could be hard to tell if you have new water messes or old water messes when you're testing the connections and such for your new tank. Contact a water damage company and your insurance agent to start the process right away because time is of the essence.</p>
