<h2>Water Heater Services Richmond Texas</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>3. If you are not getting the same hot water as you used to, then you probably need a new heater or to at least have it checked.

Upgrading to an energy efficient water heater will save a great deal of money over the life of the unit.</p>
<p>A conventional water heater is a large tank that takes up a lot of floor space. More Storage Space: Get a lot more storage space in your home by switching to a tankless water heater. A tankless system works by heating water using heating elements as it travels through the system after you turn on the hot water tap.

Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity. Tankless systems heat water by activating a set of coils that become hot when the unit is turned on. As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>
