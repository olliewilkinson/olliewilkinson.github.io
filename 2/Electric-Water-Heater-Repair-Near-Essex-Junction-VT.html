While this is not something that people are too happy about, it is so important to get a replacement for your water heater when it is needed.</p>

<p>Therefore, if water is leaking directly from the tank, it's time to replace your water heater. A tankless heater can supply no more than its flow rate, typically 2 to 5 gallons per minute. Having been the industry standard for home hot water, you're likely quite familiar with a tank water heater. Unlike conventional water heaters, there is no backup hot water source during these emergency situations.

<p>Your water heater may be undersized. When you end up doing a comparison with a tankless gas water heater with that of heater that utilizes both electricity and a tank, you will find the differences are enormous.

The main difference between electric and gas water heaters is the heat source. Once power and water supply issues are addressed, a tankless water heater is fairly straightforward to install and is certainly much easier to maneuver into place.</p>
