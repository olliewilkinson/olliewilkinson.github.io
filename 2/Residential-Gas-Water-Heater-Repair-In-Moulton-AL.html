Most water heaters in New Mexico use natural gas and this means you have to burn combustible fuel to heat your water. You can achieve even greater energy savings of 27%-50% if you install a demand water heater at each hot water outlet. A conventional water heater burns money, as it is constantly heating water you don't use.</p>
<p>Hot water tanks typically last an average of 10 years, with variables like the condition of your water supply and frequency of preventative maintenance playing significant roles in your system's useful life. A water heater that's right for you. Connect with dedicated hoses the hot water outlet and the cold water inlet via the pressure relief valve. While your choice of water heater will cause a greater or lesser upfront cost, over time this will all average out to where you end up paying about the same over five years.</p>
