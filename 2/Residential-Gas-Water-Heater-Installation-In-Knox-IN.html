<h2>Water Heater Services Knox Indiana</h2>
<p>Electric tankless hot water heaters come in very useful sizes - from something that looks like a loaf of bread to some the size of a PC. All have the capability of providing instant hot water on demand. Tankless water heaters are all the rage. As for the cold water side, if you have a shut off valve that is in good shape, you'll want to cut below that so that you can keep the water on to the rest of the house and if not, you'll have to shut off the water at the main and I suggest installing a new valve while you have this all opened up. These standby losses may represent 10% to 20% of a home's yearly water heating expense.</p>
<p>Cleaner water - A tankless unit provides cleaner water too. Energy conservation is a great feature of on-demand tankless water heaters, but it's not the only great feature. Whether you're showering, washing clothing, doing dishes, or just brewing coffee, it's important to have access to hot water when you want it. We care about your home's plumbing system and want to make sure your water heater is running properly.</p>
<p>This problem is only compounded as sediment build up in the tank over time and reduces the amount of hot water the tank can store. In the case of installing electric tankless water heaters you may be required to have an electrician upgrade the electrical service to your home or plug, depending on its age and set up. We have a wide variety of gas and electric tank water heaters available in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>

Rarely, both elements will test OK, but you're still not getting hot water.</p>
<p>Whether you are looking for a water heating system for your new home or your current system has seen better days and needs a replacement, one of the first things you need to do is to look at all of your available options and weigh their pros and cons. How many GPM a tankless heater can deliver is entirely dependent on how much energy (either electric or gas) the unit has available to heat the water. These types of water heaters are able to last 20 years, whereas tank water heaters last 10 to 15 years.</p>

<p>Natural gas tankless water heaters have more output of hot water compared to an electric water heaters. Most water heater brands will not warranty parts if the heater is not maintained properly.

<p>Problems such as rusty or discolored water, strange noises or low or no heat are also indicators it's time to get your water heater repaired or replaced. A tankless water heater is also called an "on-demand" water heater, because it only heats water when you turn on the hot water tap. Tankless water heaters take up very little space because they have no capacity to store water; instead, cold water is piped through a heat exchanger and heated to a preset temperature range.</p>

DIY water heater installations can be costly and ineffective. Sometimes however you may not have to replace the entire unit, but call a plumbing contractor for your water heater repair if the leak originates from the top.

A tankless water heater is a system of heating your household water that doesn't require the standard water tank of a traditional system. Your water heater is one of the most important parts of your home. Heater Size: If your unit is too small, it will not be able to heat water efficiently.</p>
