You can be assured your local plumbing company is up-to-date with all local code requirements and safe installation practices: Local plumbers know when and how to pull a permit.</p>
<p>If the water heater is located in an attic, water damage can result in every ceiling and floor beneath the water heater. Your water requirements will also have to be considered when choosing a tankless water heater. Our GoHot tankless heater is only the size of a briefcase. Since we are talking about electric tankless, the only thing I will say about gas models is that they almost always have better performance than electric models.</p>
<p>The maintenance necessary for your water heater depends on location, design of the unit, quality of installation, water quality, and manufacturer recommendations. You usually notice a leak when there is a puddle around the bottom of the water heater or they may be a trail leading back to the tank. Note: Unless the water heater stopped working more than a few hours ago, the water spilling out will be hot. Instead of storing heated water in tank, it supplies water only when needed.</p>

<p>They can cut your water heating bills in half and earn you a nice utility rebate from Duke Energy. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day. Because they use up to 30 to 50 percent less energy, tankless units can save an average family about $100 or more annually, depending on water usage. Regular maintenance is required for a longer life of a water heater.</p>
<p>It takes a good amount of time for the tank to fill back up, turn on the burner, and heat the water. In a gas based tankless system, the gas heater is responsible for heating the water. If you answered no” to one or more of these questions, especially, question #1, you should probably hold off and stick with a tank-style heater. We can relocate your water heater if needed. After you are sure that everything is connected back properly, open the valve to fill the tank up, while this is happening i would open up a few hot water faucets just to get some of the air out.</p>

Electric water heaters are powered by standard electricity to heat and cool the water that flows to your tubs, showers, sinks, dishwasher, and washing machine. Because tankless heaters do not store water, they are less subject to corrosion than tank-type heaters. All Pro Plumbing, Heating, Air & Electrical has all your water heater services covered.</p>

<p>Initial Cost - Tank heaters are cheaper to purchase and typically less expensive to install. However, f you use more hot water daily (around 86 gallons or more), then you may only get to enjoy an additional 8-10% energy efficiency. With sediment piling up on the bottom of your tank, your water heater is trying to heat water through the mound of dirt, leading to a longer wait time for your water to heat.

With many water pipes hooking to your heater and home's plumbing systems, you could cause more damage than good if you accidentally unscrew the wrong pipe.
