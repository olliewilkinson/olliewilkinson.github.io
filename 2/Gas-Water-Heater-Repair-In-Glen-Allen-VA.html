<h2>Water Heater Services Glen Allen Virginia</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work. The age is also going to be affected by how much this water heater is used, as more wear and tear can cause the product to age faster. Old hot water heaters have parts that are worn. Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>

Plumbers must get a special certification in order to perform gas plumbing services, and the average homeowner simply doesn't have the knowledge to do these tasks safely.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Glen Allen Virginia 23060</h3>
<p>Typically, water heaters that are over 10 years old need replacement, but with annual maintenance you may be able to prolong the water heater's life to 15 or 20 years. They cost more up front than standard electric models, but use about 60% less energy, meaning homeowners tend to see a return on their investment in the form of lower energy bills. If it's time to replace your conventional water heater with something better, a tankless unit might be the perfect choice.</p>
<p>Depending on your household size and personal energy-saving goals, a tankless water heater may be right for you. It is never recommended that you attempt to replace a gas or electric water heater if you are not specifically trained to do so. Improper installation of water heaters may cause fire or explosion. Knowing when your tankless water heater is malfunctioning or damaged will give you the knowledge to call for repairs at the right time.</p>
<p>If a gas line has to be added or relocated, then a plumbing permit may be required for the modifications or changes; note that just one permit may cover both the water heater and plumbing modifications. Persistent noises: Sometimes the tank makes noises because the heating element is burning out. Since PSE&G is not a Licensed Master Plumber, we use authorized licensed installers to provide the optional WorryFree Water Heater Replacement Service.</p>
<p>When you turn on the hot water for your morning shower and are greeted with tepid temperatures, you know you're in for a rough morning. So choosing the right tankless model can be complicated especially if you don't have some skills in DIY and knowledge in plumbing. If you plan on having multiple appliances running at any given time off one hot water supply, it's a good idea to get a larger system. Whether you have a tank, hybrid, or tankless water heater, your local Aire Serv technicians will provide services designed to extend the life of your water heater.</p>
<p>Not all water heaters can be repaired. The great news is that there are only a few things that can go wrong with water heaters because they have only a few parts. So that increases the installation cost even further. If you flush your tank heater annually and call for professional service when you experience any operational issues, you will ensure your heater the maximum lifespan. High Energy Bills: Your water heater, particularly if you have a traditional tanked unit, is one of the highest consumers of electricity.</p>
