<p>Tankless water heaters remove the need for a bulky water tank. Paloma tankless has a variety of heater which you could chose form either it is for your house, or for commercial use. Setting the top thermostat higher will not cause the top element to turn on if the water temperature in the top of the tank is already higher than the highest setting of the thermostat. This strategy saves water as well as energy, thereby making this option one of the most efficient, as well as saving on space.</p>
<p>For residential applications, the hot water set point temperature should be only slightly above the highest temperature needed for domestic uses. A lot of times when this happens, its because the necessary repairs and maintenance were not scheduled for your water heater. Since the issue just started after you installed the tankless water heater, I would highly recommend calling the water heater company and asking them to come to take a look.</p>
<p>Incorrect Size: When you first bought your water heater, it could've been the perfect size for your needs-things change as well as water needs, so you may want a new water heater to meet those specific needs. Once it has been determined that a tankless heater will benefit you, our professionally trained technicians will assess your ground water temperature and determine the flow of water through your home or business to help determine which model will be the best fit for your needs.</p>

<p>You can also use a tankless hot water system which effectively only heats the water that you need when you need it. This certifies that the water is not always heated multiple times inside the big tank. These layers make the tank use more energy to heat up, causing the unit to overheat and weaken. When this happens, the pressure inside your water heater will build up and an explosion will occur. According to Home Depot, the chart below can help you determine how big of a tank water heater you need for your household.</p>

Turn on the water on the hot side at a tub spout and bleed all the air out of the water heater and water lines. A fully installed water heater can cost up to $5,000.
