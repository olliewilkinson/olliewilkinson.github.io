<h3>Affordable Hot Water Heater Installation Lithia Springs</h3>
<p>In the event that this valve does not work then you know you will have to start looking for a replacement. Some residential water heaters seem to have been placed by chance rather function. Before you decide to purchase a new water heater, you may want to determine if it can, in fact, be repaired. Tankless water heaters can be sized to provide a continuous flow of hot water, making them suitable for large families that use a lot of hot water at one time.</p>
<p>They can cut your water heating bills in half and earn you a nice utility rebate from Duke Energy. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day. Because they use up to 30 to 50 percent less energy, tankless units can save an average family about $100 or more annually, depending on water usage. Regular maintenance is required for a longer life of a water heater.</p>
<p>For instance, sediment has the tendency to build up at the bottom of the tank over time, which can decrease the efficiency — and the life — of the tank, and even go as far as clogging up water lines.

<p>Before you get a new water heater, you'll want to determine which system best meets your family's demands. Storage tank sizes are determined by the size and hot water requirements of the household it is to serve. The key is picking the most efficient water heater large enough to handle your needs. While a water heater replacement is needed on occasion, a lot of times homeowners and business owners don't know when a replacement is needed.</p>
<p>Age: If your unit is older, and especially if it requires repairs or replacement parts to keep it functioning, it can be more cost-effective to install a new unit. Frequent breakdowns are a good indicator that it may be time for a full water heater replacement. Tank-style heaters don't produce hot water instantly either but since they have a supply ready to go and don't need to kick on, it reaches the outlet more quickly.</p>
