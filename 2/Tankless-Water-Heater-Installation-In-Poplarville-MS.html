<h2>Water Heater Services Poplarville Mississippi</h2>
<p>There are good reasons to hire a plumber for a water heater installation. Before you call the professionals, you can troubleshoot your malfunctioning hot water dispenser on your own. We take care of all your tankless water heater repair and installation services. We have provided outstanding plumbing services since 1980 and have plenty of experience with all types of water heaters. To remove the old water heater, shut off the valves on the two water lines (one inlet and one outlet) leading into the existing water heater.</p>
<p>It'll cost you anywhere from $300 to $2,000 for a hot water tank style heater. Depending on your location and other components, you have several choices for powering your new water heater. Some people say that tankless installation is more expensive, and for some this may be true. Drain the water from the tank and unscrew the old element using a heating element wrench. And that's not the only benefit they provide: they take up a lot less space, have a longer lifespan, save energy because they don't have to keep a tank full of water heated around the clock, and ultimately save you money in operating costs in the long run.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>

<p>Electric water heater: Connect the circuit wires to the water heater leads in the electrical junction box on the heater unit. A propane appliance like a hot water tank is a little less forgiving of problems than some of the larger built-in units you would find in most homes, so ensuring it is properly cleaned and maintained will help it last longer as well as keep you safer. In many cases it is a simple fix and does not require a new hot water heater.</p>

<p>Whether we simply need to replace a broken part, remove excess sediment, repair the heating element, or do something else entirely, we'll make safety our priority. You waste more water because tankless heaters have to heat the water first since there isn't a tank full already waiting.

These steps may have a more immediate effect upon your energy usage than installing a tankless water heater will.</p>

There will be either a lever or knob on one of the water pipes coming out of the wall to the water heater. Use dielectric fittings when connecting copper pipe to steel water heater connections. As long as your unit is the right capacity for the number of people in your home, that should mean no one ever has to settle for cold or lukewarm water again.</p>
