<h2>Water Heater Services Catskill New York</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>Although it rarely happens, explosions are a serious risk with tank-style water heaters. A gas-powered tankless system has to use burners just like a tank system. However, they're also more costly to install and may struggle to provide hot water to multiple fixtures or appliances simultaneously. Tank water heaters are a common type of water heater. While they can be much more expensive than traditional units, tankless water heaters do deliver big long-term savings.</p>
<p>The truth behind the myth is that the only part of the water heater which necessitates replacement is a leak in the tank itself. Another sort of water heater pumps the heat around the plumbing system, while an indirect water heater heats the water through the house's general heating system. No matter your reason for choosing a tankless version, you can rest assured that our fully licensed contractors have the knowledge, skills, and resources to complete your tankless water heater installation quickly and efficiently.</p>

It's Making Noise - As your water heats, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Catskill New York 12414</h3>
<p>To avoid flooding from tank failure, Bill Smith Plumbing & Heating offers alarm and cold water shut-off valve options. Our experienced technicians are equipped and trained for electric water heater repair. When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution. Traditional water heaters work by heating and storing a set amount of water in a tank. Turning on hot water throughout the home activates the heater, even if the pilot light is not on, so you are able to check the pipes for leaks much more easily.</p>
<p>For instance, for a home with two stories and a basement, the worst place to install the heater is in the basement. However if you find that you have no hot water with an electric tank it would be a good idea to check your breaker to see if the breaker has tripped. A broken or deteriorated dip tube can cause the cold water to stay near the top, making your water heater unable to heat the water properly. There are a lot of reasons why a homeowner or business owner might choose to upgrade to a new water heater, with some of them ranging from the size to the water heater's ability to heat up water.</p>
<p>Whole-home tankless gas water heaters have specific flow rates that are relative to the necessary temperature rise. With new water heater efficiency standards, we now have the opportunity to have it all. Although gas and electric water heaters can lose some efficiency because water is constantly being heated in the tank, current efficiency standards are much improved over the past. Most water heaters are gas, so even the smallest of mistakes made during installation can cause added expenses, property damage, injury, or even death.</p>
<p>Tightening the heating element mounting bolt - Make sure not to overtighten this, though. Installing a whole-house water softener can mitigate calcium buildup, lengthening the life of your water heater. We offer both conventional and tankless water heater options, rebates and eco-friendly discounts. But, as the concept of heating water on demand become more popular, and because tankless water heaters are more energy efficient, homebuilders began installing them.</p>
<p>Some of these heaters are more energy efficient than other kinds. The purchase price of gas powered heaters may be a little bit higher, but they are cheaper to operate overall. Also, since combustion takes place in the heating process using gas there needs to be adequate ventilation for both combustion (fresh air flow) and exhaust.
