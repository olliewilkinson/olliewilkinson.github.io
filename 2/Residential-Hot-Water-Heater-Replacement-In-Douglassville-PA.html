<h2>Water Heater Services Douglassville Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Installing a tankless gas water heater is a very worthwhile investment and one that will pay for itself in a very short period of time. Without a warranty, you could end up spending a lot more on repairs of an old water heater than you would if you upgraded to a new model. Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed. However, you also have to decide between these three tankless water venting systems: a direct vent system, a non-direct vent system, or an outdoor tankless system.</p>
<p>1. Tankless water heaters require regular ongoing maintenance in order to run at their best efficiency. This requires a great deal of energy and puts incredible strain on the unit, which is why storage water heaters wear out after only eight to 12 years. In addition, SETS tankless water heaters are the only systems that offer a 100% lifetime parts replacement warranty. The downside is that, if you have multiple showers running at the same time, tankless water heaters are not able to keep up. This isn't just a problem with showers, depending on the size of your water heater, you can run into issues by having a shower and the dishwasher running at the same time.</p>
<p>If your heater is in an inconvenient spot or a tight space, a tankless system might be able to help you out. It takes 60-70 minutes to heat a 100-gallon tank (recovery rate) with gas. Step 2. Turn off the gas going to the water heater at the valve that connects to the front of the water heater. According to HomeAdvisor , it can take up to 20 years for your tankless heater to pay for itself with energy bill savings.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Douglassville</h3>
<p>If your water comes out smelling like rotten eggs, there could be bacteria in the hot water heater tank. In our Chicago climate we experience extremely cold weather that can occasionally cause a main water line or incorrectly installed tankless water heater to freeze and prevent water from flowing. However, tankless water heaters are more energy efficient because you're only heating water as you need it. A water heater with a tank needs energy to heat up to 100 gallons, for example, and then needs energy to keep it hot all day long or until it's used.</p>
<p>If you go to turn on the sink or shower only to find that no hot water will come out, it's pretty obvious there's something wrong with your water heater. Whether you need water heater repairs or a new water heater, The Furnace Guy Heating can help. Your water heater takes up too much space: Save room by upgrading to a compact, wall-mounted tankless water heater. This is compared to traditional water heaters, which only last 10-15 years.</p>
<p>The good thing is that they can be replaced; however, this is another instance where a professional plumbing tech should look the heater over to see if there aren't any other glaring issues. As such, the most dangerous problem that could ever occur would be a serious leak with your water heater. If you closed the hot water faucet, you should open it again, as well as the T&P valve This will help the water drain faster by allowing air into the tank.</p>
<p>AirPlus technicians are trained to do residential & commercial water heater installation, maintenance, inspection & repairs. Tankless water heaters are the latest innovation in home water heaters. A Traditional water heater stores and preheats 30-50 gallons of water in a tank.
