<p>In the world of tankless electric water heaters, Joe from New York is going to need more power to achieve the same temperature of hot water as Jane from Florida.

The employees are excellent to work with: sales, repair, installation, follow-up.</p>
<p>Determining whether you should repair your water heater or purchase a new one depends solely on what is wrong with it in the first place. They know from experience which models of heaters tend to hold up the best to the hard water. Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity. Tankless systems heat water by activating a set of coils that become hot when the unit is turned on. As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>
<p>Tankless heaters take up less space compared to the space of a 20 or 80-gallon tank. Single point tankless units can be installed on the interior or exterior of the building near the water use point and no more than 50 ft. from an adjacent power source (typically requiring 220 volts) if using an electric heater. Typically, tankless water heaters, which heat water only when you need it, cost more but can save about 25 percent of annual water heating costs, on average.</p>

<p>Water consumption (amount of hot water to be used) is another important factor in determining which heating system to purchase. Denver water is quite cold, which creates condensation on the walls of hot water storage tanks. Electric water heaters use, you guessed it- electricity, to heat the water.

<p>Gas water heaters will have a higher FHR compared to an electric heater with the same sized tank.

The installation process is more time-consuming, and fewer plumbers know how to install them correctly.</p>
