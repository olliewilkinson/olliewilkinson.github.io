<h2>Water Heater Services Walnut Cove North Carolina</h2>
<p>With all of the different problems that can result from having a hot water heater, it's always good to know what the most common ones are and how to handle them. If your demand is higher, then a whole house” tankless water heater or two or more tankless systems will be able to keep up with the demand of your household. When you choose to retrofit a tankless water heater in place of a storage tank variety, your plumber-installer will take more time, increasing the installed cost, of replacing a storage tank water heater because of the complexity of relocating existing piping.</p>
<p>If a water heater is installed without a T&P valve (temperature and pressure relief valve) it may explode. Tankless water heaters are not measured on the capacity of water they hold but on how many gallons of hot water they can produce per minute. There are three main reasons why your electric heater might not be producing hot water. There are different brand names of tankless water heaters to choose from since this kind of home appliances is in demand in the market with different designs, sizes and features.</p>

Only heats water when you need it, so energy isn't wasted for hot water that's not needed right away. Many people try to cut water usage in an effort to reduce this lost energy, but they don't realize that the heat is still generated throughout the day, whether or not they actually use the hot water in the tank.</p>
<p>If the element has a short, power will flow through the metal tank of the water heater. The average life span of a water heater is between 8 and 12 years.
