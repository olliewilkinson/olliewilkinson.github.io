Storage tank: Storage tank water heaters typically have a capacity of 30 to 60 gallons, but the most common size is 50 gallons. The disadvantage with this tankless gas heater is that it takes a few seconds before hot water starts flowing. You don't know how old the water heater is or when it was last serviced. If all of these advantages sound good to you, call us today at 423-718-7342 for tankless water heater installation services.</p>
<p>As with many household devices, water heaters become more expensive to maintain as they get older. For this reason, you need a repair expert who is experienced in handling tankless style heaters, and that's exactly what HomeWorks water heater repair technicians can offer you. Whereas your normal tank for replacement can be had anywhere from $150 to over $1000, plus installation costs of $200 to $400, an instant model will run from about $400 - $3000 with additional costs for installation, particularly if the supply lines and venting options for gas are not adequate.</p>
<p>While most homeowners are used to their tanked system, a tankless water heater offers improved performance while saving on energy costs. Configuration of water heater: some electrical systems and configurations may need to be updated to accommodate the voltage requirements of the new electric tankless system.

Setting the top thermostat higher will not cause the top element to turn on if the water temperature in the top of the tank is already higher than the highest setting of the thermostat. This strategy saves water as well as energy, thereby making this option one of the most efficient, as well as saving on space.</p>
<p>Your hot water is rust-colored: This is likely a sign that the inside of your tank is rusting, which means it's aging and breaking down. Another option, one that Petersen Plumbing is seeing more and more often in the market today, is the tankless water heater, sometimes called an on-demand water heater. From standard tank water heaters to tankless to solar water heaters, we offer a solution that will fit your needs and save energy.</p>

When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution. Traditional water heaters work by heating and storing a set amount of water in a tank.

<p>Some of the common geyser repairs that we encounter and fix are overheating of water, water not heating enough or not heating at all, rust colored water, automatic heating function not working, water dripping from geyser (leakage), etc. To install the water heater in its place, start by pre-screwing the 4 bolts from your fixing kit into the rods. This is not covered in the video, but you should always check that the water heater is not receiving any electricity after shutting it off at the circuit breaker.</p>
<p>If you're anything like the average homeowner, you use your water heater daily. Along with the insulated foam, water heaters are now made with a glass liner inside to prevent corrosion from the minerals in the water.
