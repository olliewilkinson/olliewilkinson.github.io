Tankless water heaters have become increasingly popular due to their efficiency and compact size. Several smaller units cannot produce enough hot water for simultaneous purposes in large families. As many homeowners look for ways to lower their energy costs, one area of improvement is water heating.</p>

If the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a new one, getting a new one is more economical.</p>
