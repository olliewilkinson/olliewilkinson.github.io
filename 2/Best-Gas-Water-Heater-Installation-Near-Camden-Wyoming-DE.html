<p>Buyers must also have realistic expectations regarding the performance of the tankless water heater they intend to buy. The tanklees electric water heater heats the water immediately when it is turned on.

To overcome this problem, you can install a whole house” type tankless water heater or install two or more tankless water heaters, connected in parallel for simultaneous demands of hot water.</p>
<p>Because it's constantly heating and reheating water throughout the day. Heating your water can consume a lot of energy. Water heaters should be serviced regularly in order to preserve their functionality, and repairs may be necessary after substantial use or as the heater grows older, however, they simply don't last forever. Heaters can switch off if there is low water pressure, so the minimum flow rate specification is important here and it has limited capacity for heating.</p>
