<h2>Water Heater Services Brentwood California</h2>
<p>A tankless water heater provides water as it is needed. This saves you from needing to drain the entire water heater.

<h3>Local Tankless Water Heater Replacement Brentwood</h3>
<p>If the water coming out of your faucets is way too hot or it steams, it's possible that the water heater isn't shutting off at the temperature it's supposed to.

Our factory trained technicians provide 24 hour emergency service on all makes and models, and same day replacement with no charge for removal and disposal of your old water heater.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are a relatively new entrant into the market, but they work quite well for most homeowners.

Check the literature for the brand heater you are considering and find the output in gallons per minute (GPM) at the temperature rise you need.</p>
<p>However, if you're considering an electric tankless water heater, you'll need to make sure your home's electric panel can handle the added load. The first of course is there is no storage tank to run out of hot water. For those who have gas water heaters, the problem could lie in a gas leak.
