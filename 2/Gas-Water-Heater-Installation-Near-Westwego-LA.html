If your existing unit has seen better days, a water heater replacement is often the best course of action.</p>
<p>A concentric vent, which has an exhaust pipe inside a larger air-intake pipe, simplifies installation because only one hole needs to be cut in the wall. Turn on the water on the hot side at a tub spout and bleed all the air out of the water heater and water lines. A fully installed water heater can cost up to $5,000. Hard water (meaning it has a higher mineral content) in San Diego and surrounding areas causes a scale buildup that can damage heating elements.</p>
