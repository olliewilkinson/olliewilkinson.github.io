Storage tank: Storage tank water heaters typically have a capacity of 30 to 60 gallons, but the most common size is 50 gallons. The disadvantage with this tankless gas heater is that it takes a few seconds before hot water starts flowing. You don't know how old the water heater is or when it was last serviced.

In addition, SETS tankless water heaters are the only systems that offer a 100% lifetime parts replacement warranty.

This isn't just a problem with showers, depending on the size of your water heater, you can run into issues by having a shower and the dishwasher running at the same time.</p>
<p>This problem is only compounded as sediment build up in the tank over time and reduces the amount of hot water the tank can store.
