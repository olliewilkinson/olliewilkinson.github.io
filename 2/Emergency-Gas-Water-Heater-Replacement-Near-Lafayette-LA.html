<h2>Water Heater Services Lafayette Louisiana</h2>
<p>All households require hot water, so your water heater is one of your most essential home appliances. As the name suggests, this type of water heater does not have a storage tank. Regularly scheduled maintenance can help extend the life of the water heater and it includes performing a water heater flush, checking the valves and connections for leaks and more. If you are not looking to apply more then one outlet then you would be well served by the standard and far less expensive model of the tankless water heater.</p>
<p>This is because the flow of energy is easier to regulate with an electric connection, plus the pilot light has to be properly ignited with a gas connection. And no tanks means no hot water sitting unused, reducing your overall heating costs by hundreds of dollars. If it's too big, you may be spending more money than necessary to heat up the water within the tank. We keep water heaters stocked at TLC so we can replace your water heater day or night.</p>
<p>Hot water tanks typically last an average of 10 years, with variables like the condition of your water supply and frequency of preventative maintenance playing significant roles in your system's useful life. A water heater that's right for you. Connect with dedicated hoses the hot water outlet and the cold water inlet via the pressure relief valve. While your choice of water heater will cause a greater or lesser upfront cost, over time this will all average out to where you end up paying about the same over five years.</p>

Hot water system installation cost depends on the distance from the existing hot water system installation and the electrical work required. Alternatively, odd noises coming from the water heater itself could point to sediment being burned by the heating element in the tank, or the heating element itself.</p>
<p>With a standard unit you have to keep reheating the water over and over again, day after day, and year after year but a tankless hot water heater gives you an endless supply and uses about 50% less electricity. In regards to the cost of operation, natural gas and propane water heaters are less expensive to operate than electric or oil units of the same size. Traditional water heaters have hot water sitting at the top of the tank ready to go. On a tankless unit, cold water enters the heat exchanger tubing and begins to be heated.</p>
<p>The process of heating the water is triggered when the tankless hot water heater senses the demand for hot water, which occurs when you turn on the hot water tap. In this case, the expanding water flows into the expansion tank rather than your pipes. Removal of a water heater requires the power source to be disconnected and the tank to be completely drained.

If your water comes out of the faucet with a brown, yellow, or red tint to it, there could be corrosion occurring inside your water heater tank or in the pipes in your home.
