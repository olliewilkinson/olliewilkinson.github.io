We will show you the potential causes and after you enter your model number into the search field, we'll sell you the exact part that fits your water heater and show you how to install it. Light the pilot light in the new water heater and adjust the temperature setting.

<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work.
