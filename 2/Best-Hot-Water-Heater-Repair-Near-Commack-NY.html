<p>Gas tankless: Gas-fueled tankless heaters are small units that hang on the wall and require more fuel to heat water than standard gas heaters with tanks. Scale buildup can make water heater and dishwasher units less energy efficient while shortening the life of equipment and clogging your faucets and taps. Call Design Air for professional water heater installation services. First, heat rises and you are using a gas-powered unit, so if you live in a very hot climate, this could be dangerous.</p>
