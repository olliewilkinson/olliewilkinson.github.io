If there's a major problem with your water heater or it's more than 12-15 years old, it may be time to consider a new one.

Three inch tubing is a minimum and should be exhausted through the roof or side wall with the appropriate tubing and vent cap.

<p>But … tankless water heaters may still encounter repair needs that will require calling on a professional plumber. Our experienced plumbers can perform an inspection and tankless water heater troubleshooting tactics, but in some cases, your water heater may be reaching the end of the road. Aside from this feature, tankless water heaters have low maintenance and running costs. These systems are also called on demand” and instant” water heaters because they heat water which enters your home through your plumbing system instantly.</p>
<p>Using a traditional circulating pump will void the warranty on most tankless heaters, since they will cause the heater to turn on and off very frequently and far more than in typical household usage. If you know you have a recirculating loop for you water heater, it is a good idea to have a ball valve before the point where the loop connects to you water heater.

With fewer components and no bulky water tank, you will require fewer repairs and your unit will last about 5-10 years longer than a traditional unit. Storage tank water heaters store 40 to 120 gallons of water at a time and constantly reheat that water regardless of how much is actually demanded.</p>
<p>Because water heaters are in constant contact with water, it's common for them to deteriorate over time. The overall cost of owning a water heater will depend on a number of factors such as the number of people using the heater, operating expenses, and remodeling done in the home. Nothing lasts forever, least of all a water heater. The calcified minerals clog the drain valve, slow the heating process, overheating the bottom of your tank and affecting the metal integrity of your tank's walls to the point where leaks can and do occur.</p>
