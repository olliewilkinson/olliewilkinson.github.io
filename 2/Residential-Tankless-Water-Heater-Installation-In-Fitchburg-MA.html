<h2>Water Heater Services Fitchburg Massachusetts</h2>
<p>If you are thinking of replacing your gas tank-style unit with a tankless model, you should consider an outdoor installation. An electric water heater has an upper and a lower heating element. Storage tank: Storage tank water heaters typically have a capacity of 30 to 60 gallons, but the most common size is 50 gallons. The disadvantage with this tankless gas heater is that it takes a few seconds before hot water starts flowing. You don't know how old the water heater is or when it was last serviced. If all of these advantages sound good to you, call us today at 423-718-7342 for tankless water heater installation services.</p>
<p>Your water heater is your last defense for dealing with freezing cold water, which is why you should always stay on top of regular maintenance and care. Whether it's powered by electricity or natural gas, your water heater isn't built to last forever. Once the system is all hooked up and properly tested, you're ready to start using your new water heating system. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that in homes using 41 gallons or less of hot water, on-demand tankless units can conserve between 24% to 34% more energy than tank water heaters.</p>
<p>The truth behind the myth is that the only part of the water heater which necessitates replacement is a leak in the tank itself. Another sort of water heater pumps the heat around the plumbing system, while an indirect water heater heats the water through the house's general heating system. No matter your reason for choosing a tankless version, you can rest assured that our fully licensed contractors have the knowledge, skills, and resources to complete your tankless water heater installation quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>Turn off the water and gas or electric before you begin, and take particular care to vent gas models properly. Use 2 T joints to divide the hot and cold water inlets, so as to fit the water heater onto one side and the shower, sink, bath or washbasin on the other side. With an electric hot water heater, several other components could be causing you to lose hot water. Solar water heaters work using roof-mounted solar panels that absorb the sun's heat and transfer it to an antifreeze-like fluid in a closed-loop system that runs to the water tank and heats the water.</p>
<p>Thanks to the low emission of potentially health-threatening elements tankless water heaters are environment-friendly. If your current hot water heater cannot meet your needs, new water heater installation is likely the best choice. Higher installation cost - You might run into a higher installation cost because of venting requirements, as well as the placement of additional tankless units around the home. If your existing hot water heater is good, just requiring maintenance, minor repairs, or new fittings, we can get you working again in no time.</p>
<p>The drain valve is located at the bottom of the water heater. And there are no large electrical power demands needed as with the electric heater. Not enough hot water may also mean that your water heater is on its last leg and needs to be replaced. With a tankless water heater you can eliminate this heat loss because the water is only heated when you need it. This can end up saving money on your monthly energy bill and conserve energy.</p>
