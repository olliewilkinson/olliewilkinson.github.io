<p>Strategically planning the location of your tankless water heater maximizes its flow and water temperatures. When you turn on the faucet, warm water is pumped from the top of the tank to where you need it and cold water is pumped into the bottom of the tank to be heated until its ready for use. Even though tankless water heaters can deliver an unlimited amount of hot water, there's a limit to how much water can be delivered at once.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, a tank heater only lasts about 10-12 years before having to be replaced, mostly because of corrosion inside the tank. Both these models are tankless and use natural gas, although you can also find models that use propane gas. Gas tankless water heaters are more expensive to install.

<p>The Lifetime Unit Replacement Limited Warranty is valid for as long as the original purchaser owns their home. This saves energy and equals a lower heating bill. The dip tube is responsible for bringing water into your water heater to be warmed up. When the dip tube cracks, it sends cold water with the outgoing hot water. For you to install a tankless gas water heater you need to have the capability to have gas pumped into your home.</p>
<p>If you can't confidently say you know how to install a water heater you really need to use caution. As opposed to waiting for a storage tank to fill with enough hot water for use, tankless water heaters provide a constant supply of it. If you're looking for an energy-efficient option to supply your home with hot water, tankless water heaters are worth serious consideration. However, tankless water heaters are becoming standard in new developments, so if you live in a newer home or a home that has recently been remodeled, you may have a tankless system supplying hot water to your home.</p>
<p>Also, electric heaters last only about half as long as gas units: Typical warranties are three to five years. Repair your water heater.

<p>And don't miss out on our special offers on water heaters. Depending on your home and hot water demand, you may need to install a whole-home system one (or more) point-of-use units.
