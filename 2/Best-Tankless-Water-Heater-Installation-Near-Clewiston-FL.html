<h2>Water Heater Services Clewiston Florida</h2>
<p>While the process of installing a tankless water heater isn't too difficult it is very different from the process of installing a standard tank water heater. Choosing the right team of plumbing professionals to maintain the flow of hot water to your home or business can be a challenging and stressful decision, which is why we're proud to have been the go-to professionals for many homes and businesses in High Point, NC since 1997. Electric water heater: Confirm that the circuit is off to the water heater, using a non-contact voltage tester, then disconnect the wiring connections and circuit cable from the water heater.</p>
<p>If you currently have a gas system then purchase a tankless water heater system that also operates on gas. Plumbing-supply stores, big-box stores, and online retailers all carry these heaters. By periodically draining the water heater tank and having a thorough rinse performed by our professionals, you'll be able to keep mineral buildup to a minimum. Consequently, the lack of maintenance plays a big role in repair costs and necessity.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the type of traditional hot water tank you had, you may be able to install it in the same area. In addition to high upfront costs, smaller tankless units don't always deliver enough hot water to appliances and showers simultaneously. Our 24-hour emergency plumbers offer a complete range of solutions that can get a faulty system back up and running in no time. Many homeowners are interested in how tankless water heaters can save them money, since these units are more energy efficient than their tank counterparts.</p>
<h3>Affordable Hot Water Heater Installation Clewiston</h3>
<p>This may be an old resistive type heater and should be replaced by more modern heaters that can be up to 5 times more efficient at heating water. Savings: Unlike traditional water heaters, tankless units only heat water as it is needed, which results in extra energy savings per month. Although gas tankless water heaters are clearly more efficient than their storage tank cousins, their efficiency normally tops out at 80-85%.</p>
<p>Prices vary depending on the option purchased, but the average price on these heaters is about $500. While you look for a unit, consider the following things: fuel types (gas or electric, unit type (tank or tankless), the length and coverage or warranty, how many people live in your home, long-term maintenance requirements, and operating costs. Our hot water installation services are second to none because we only employ technicians who have been certified to handle the job.</p>
<p>But, optimizing the location relative to the plumbing fixtures in your home or business will also reduce your energy bill and water consumption. In fact, your home's gas piping, gas meter and gas line to the meter may not be sized appropriately to handle the high gas load that will be replacing the conventional storage gas water heater. The next indication that you can use to determine you need a new water heater is that there is an actual leak on the tank itself.</p>
<p>Most of the time, if you are not getting hot water, it is because the pilot light on your water heater is out. It is recommended that you hire a licensed, professional to install your water heater. We are the leading water heaters company in the region and are known for providing prompt and high quality gas & electric water heater repair services. Hot water heater replacement shouldn't be a gamble for your family.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Clewiston Florida 33440</h3>
<p>Like their name implies, these compact units heat your water without the use of a cumbersome tank that takes up space in your utility room or basement. Although uncommon, issues can arise if something isn't working correctly within your water heater. Iinstead of waiting until your heater breaks, you should plan (now, while the water is hot!) for your water heater's replacement. Sometimes, however, even the largest, gas-fired model cannot supply enough hot water for simultaneous, multiple uses in large households.</p>
<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>
<p>Some of the common geyser repairs that we encounter and fix are overheating of water, water not heating enough or not heating at all, rust colored water, automatic heating function not working, water dripping from geyser (leakage), etc. To install the water heater in its place, start by pre-screwing the 4 bolts from your fixing kit into the rods. This is not covered in the video, but you should always check that the water heater is not receiving any electricity after shutting it off at the circuit breaker.</p>
<p>High energy bills - An old water heater may be working harder than it needs to and, in turn, raising your energy bills unnecessarily. Might not heat water to high enough temperature in winter, depending on required flow rate of water. To overcome this problem, you can install a whole house” type tankless water heater or install two or more tankless water heaters, connected in parallel for simultaneous demands of hot water.</p>
<p>Gas versions use a gas burner to heat up the water as it passed through the pipe, while an electric type uses a heating element. He decides to remove and replace his failing water heater with a tankless water heater, and walks us through the process. Beyond the initial cost, the national average for the installation of a tankless unit is slightly over $1,700. A problem one contractor might solve with an inexpensive replacement of a sacrificial anode could inspire another, less scrupulous contractor to solve by recommending a brand new (and expensive) water heater.</p>
