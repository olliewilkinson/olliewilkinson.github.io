<h2>Water Heater Services Shrewsbury Massachusetts</h2>
<p>One of the most common investments a homeowner finds themselves required to make in a home is a new water heater. Many people are now going to tankless or on-demand hot water heaters simply because they are more energy efficient and use water only as it is needed. Anthony PHC Kansas City helps you upgrade to an instant water heater. In the colder months, it might not be an issue with your water heater. Before you start you need to make sure you have sufficient space for the tankless water heater you will be installing. We can even install hot water tanks in homes that are undergoing renovations because hot water plays an important role in our day-to-day activities.</p>
<p>If the water heater is located in an attic, water damage can result in every ceiling and floor beneath the water heater. Your water requirements will also have to be considered when choosing a tankless water heater. Our GoHot tankless heater is only the size of a briefcase. Since we are talking about electric tankless, the only thing I will say about gas models is that they almost always have better performance than electric models.</p>
<p>That's because homes here are usually equipped for a standard, storage tank water heater. You are not afraid of running out of hot water again since they instantly heat water instead of warming a large bath tub or pool perhaps. One solution to the long wait is to install a small tank water heater after the tankless water heater to act as a tempering tank, but once you do that, it's no longer a truly tankless system.</p>

<p>While replacing most hot water heater parts is fairly easy, it is not entirely without risk. One advantage is that since the tankless unit does not have a tank, there is no continuous heat (energy) loss from the large volume of stored heated water, as there is with a traditional storage type heater. Purchasing a tankless water heater will cost you a quite a bit more than a traditional water heater. With tankless water heaters, there is no more need for pipes running throughout your home, as they can be easily installed in your bathroom, kitchen, or garage, right at the point of use minimizing the associated piping.</p>

ECONOMICAL - Because on-demand water heaters only heat water when you need it, they don't use a constant supply of fuel. Once the tank body has sprung a leak and water starts filling the pan below the unit, that's the end of your water heater.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Shrewsbury Massachusetts 01545</h3>
<p>To minimize the cost of hot water, reduce the temperature of your hot water heater from the standard 140 degrees F to 120 degrees F. This should be an adequate supply for your family's hot water needs and the cost will be significantly lower than if you heated it continuously to the higher temperature. They constantly heat water so hot water is regularly prepared. If a tank still makes noise once sediment has been flushed, there is probably a more serious problem with the water heater overall.</p>
<p>Depending on your household size and personal energy-saving goals, a tankless water heater may be right for you.
