Electric Water Heater: For homes that are powered mainly by electricity, an electric water heater is likely the best option.</p>
<p>The more people and the more simultaneous usage possibilities, the greater the GPM needs to be. One solution is to install multiple tankless units to meet the demands of a large household, but that can become very expensive.
