Before you install an upgraded water heater, you'll want to find the system that best meets your family's needs.</p>
<p>Tankless heaters can last up to 20 years but need to be maintained at least once a year. Once the water turns off, so does the tankless unit, saving energy and reducing wear and tear. As your water heater pulls water in, it's common that traces of sediment will deposit onto the bottom of your tank. Take note of the energy sources available to you, and the amount of hot water you expect to use.
