<h2>Water Heater Services Hanover Massachusetts</h2>
<p>At Gary's Plumbing and Heating, we service all your water heating problems. The sentiment has also moved into the world of plumbing, where tankless water heaters have become popular for their ability to deliver hot water anytime it's needed. The first place to look would be the energy efficiency ratings of tank and tankless models. Tankless systems cost twice as much as traditional tank units, however because they only heat water only at the time it is being used, they are far more energy-efficient.</p>
<p>The water heater produces loud popping or cracking noises during use. So when you're experiencing issues, such as not enough hot water or no hot water at all, your first response may be just to replace it altogether. A tankless water heater usually requires a 1-inch gas pipe from the meter to the water heater. We take the guesswork out of water heater replacement. Foam pipe insulation minimizes heat loss through hot-water pipes.</p>
<p>Water in the storage tank is either heated by a pilot burner or an electrically heated element inside the tank, much like an electric thermos. They also provide an endless supply of hot water since they instantly heat water on demand. While these systems are less prone to wear than hot water heaters with tanks, they do break down over time. Your Blind & Sons plumber will perform a capacity test to determine the right size water heater for your home.</p>
<h3>Affordable Tankless Water Heater Installation Hanover</h3>
<p>We'll take a look at some potential water heater malfunctions below. However, tankless varieties are known to last longer than conventional water heater models which translates to a 20+-year useful life, as compared to storage tank types which last only 10 to 15 years before falling apart due to corrosion or part failure of some sort. Depending on where you have the water heater located inside your house, a leak could result in significant property damage.</p>
<p>The cost difference between a traditional water heater and a tankless water heater usually shows the tankless option for a whole house water heater being 2 to 3 times more expensive. Our water heater team offers all water heater services, including 24-hour emergency repairs and replacements. Defective water can heaters consume a lot of gas and electricity, so you'll save quite a bit of cash by upgrading to an Energy Star-qualified model.</p>
<p>Check the main switch on the water heater and the circuit breaker (or fuse) that serves the water heater. A tankless water heater is more expensive than its traditional counterpart. The only problem I found with it, which I later discovered that it is common to all brands of this water heaters is that the installation can be expensive, since you may need upgrades to pipes and additional electrical work. In addition, water in a tank has to be heated hotter than necessary to account for these stand-by losses.</p>
<p>If your heater is approaching old age, replacement may be smarter than repair. They can supply endless hot water because they begin heating water as soon as a faucet is turned on. So, unlike tank heaters, users never have to wait for a massive tank of water to heat up between uses.

This is not covered in the video, but you should always check that the water heater is not receiving any electricity after shutting it off at the circuit breaker.</p>
<p>You will also need to include the costs of parts and materials necessary for installation. At PV, we repair all makes and models of tankless water heaters.
