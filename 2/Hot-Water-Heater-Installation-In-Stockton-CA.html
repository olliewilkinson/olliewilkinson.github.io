<p>Instead of a vent, electric tank-type water heaters have a 220-volt power supply cable going into the top of the hot water storage tank that supplies electricity to the thermostat and heating elements. Traditional storage water tank heaters, also known as "boilers," are the most common water heaters installed and are used for central heating and can even heat the water for your home using steam. We install these new units all the time, and our customer love how much move it saves them on their utility bills each month.</p>
<p>They can cut your water heating bills in half and earn you a nice utility rebate from Duke Energy. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day. Because they use up to 30 to 50 percent less energy, tankless units can save an average family about $100 or more annually, depending on water usage. Regular maintenance is required for a longer life of a water heater.</p>
<p>In addition to customer service information, our free monthly e-newsletter is full of tips to help you save energy and money, as well as keep you safe and comfortable. Within the heat exchanger, there is an electric resistance coil that warms the water to the desired temperature as it travels through. Conventional water heaters store water at the forefront of time and use your home's electricity or gas power to heat somewhere between 30 and 50 gallons of water.</p>

Navien's Condensing Tankless Water Heaters can provide an endless supply of hot water on demand because our units activate the second you open the hot water tap. Improperly installed gas lines can leak, creating an explosion risk. Make sure the power is connected to the heater, then reset the thermostat.</p>
