<h2>Water Heater Services Sudbury Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Your next door neighbor was up all night dealing with a busted water heater and you just spent the last half hour listening to him complain. Solar water heaters use a storage tank that stores water heated by the sun. Haven Heating and Air Conditioning is your local tankless water heater repair specialist, get in touch with us today. It's these two things: Flow Rate and Gallons Per Minute that determine what size heater you need and whether it should be gas or electric. There are several factors that can affect your water heater. Whether it's installation of a brand new tank or tankless, repair of an existing tank or preventative and regular maintenance to ensure that your tank is operating at its maximum potential, the experts at AirPlus Heating & Cooling can handle it. We are able to quickly and efficiently install a new unit in your home, should it be beyond repair.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>
<p>Direct vent heaters are slightly higher in efficiency over standard water heaters but are significantly less efficient than tankless water heaters. The statistical life expectancy of a storage tank water heater is 10-12 years, depending on care and maintenance. For those suffering from a leaky water heater, John Moore can even repair your water damaged walls and floors without the headache of dealing with multiple contractors.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation Sudbury</h3>
<p>At Epic Plumbing, we specialize in tankless water heater services to benefit our customers for the long haul. Changing to a tankless system like the Tempra® eliminates these problems and results in typical savings of at least 15 - 20% on the hot water portion of your electric bill. Never attempt to do it without first reading all the instructions that can with your particular tankless water heater. While you can help prolong the life of your water heater with annual maintenance, chances are you'll need to have the pre-existing tank replaced with a new one if you occupy a given residence for more than eight years.</p>
<p>Because hot water is essential to our everyday lives, it is important to manage and maintain your hot water heater. Tankless heaters do not have a large standing water supply, instead they instantly heat the water to the necessary temperature as it is required. Hybrid electric heat pump water heaters don't work well in very cold spaces. We will send out an experienced hot water heater contractor to resolve your water heating issues and to help your home continue operating like it was meant to.</p>
<p>If you notice any of the symptoms above, your water heater system likely requires repair or replacement. As mentioned above, tankless water heaters are smaller than traditional tank heaters. If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>
<p>We provide FREE in-home Energy Consultations to evaluate your current system and help you choose the best water heater for your home. Hooking your tankless heater up to a solar system yields the best energy savings and reduces water heating expenses by 50%-80%. The Rinnai line of tankless hot water heaters feature indoor and outdoor models. But if you don't have a gas line into the house and have to use an electric unit, existing wiring may have to be upgraded.</p>

<p>Plus, there are options which take advantage of the same hookups as conventional water heaters. In fact, a tankless water heater is usually 75 percent less smaller than a regular water heater. This way, you receive instant hot water with minimal energy usage and minimal waste. Listed below are common hot water heater problems and their corresponding solutions. Gas-fired tankless heaters typically produce more hot water than electric units.</p>
<p>Tankless can also be a good choice for large families because you have more people consistently using more hot water. There are many reasons why these are much better than the tank heaters, but let's consider the most important reasons to switch over, money. If your water heater has rust-colored water or if your water heater leaks , let us know. The initial cost of a combination or integrated water and space heating system is going to cost you more than if you install a separate heater and furnace or boiler, but both installation and maintenance costs are probably going to be less.</p>
<p>You can count on our team to provide fast and prompt service, as well as do away with trip charges and overtime fees. Solar water heaters harness solar energy and heat your home's water without using any gas or electricity.

Indeed, there are many households and commercial establishments that utilize tankless water heaters.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Sudbury Massachusetts 01776</h3>
<p>Problems such as rusty or discolored water, strange noises or low or no heat are also indicators it's time to get your water heater repaired or replaced. A tankless water heater is also called an "on-demand" water heater, because it only heats water when you turn on the hot water tap. Tankless water heaters take up very little space because they have no capacity to store water; instead, cold water is piped through a heat exchanger and heated to a preset temperature range.</p>
<p>That means performing the manufacturer's recommended preventive water heater maintenance , periodically draining the tank (or lines) to remove damaging sediment and scale. Tank-type natural gas hot water heaters use ½” gas lines, while tankless hot water heaters require ¾” gas lines. Your circuit breaker might also have to be reviewed; the Electric Tankless Water Heater might also have to be installed on its own circuits.</p>
<p>Gas models can deliver up to 96% thermal efficiency and generate a constant flow of 4 gallons per minute, resulting in continuous hot water for your home. However, a broken thermostat can also tip the water temperature in the opposite direction and can mean that your hot water gets way too hot. If you hear odd sounds when you use your shower, you should contact your water heater repair contractor because something is seriously wrong with the heater.</p>
<p>It will also take a long time for the water you need to heat up, since it only starts to do so when you turn on a tap. While the water heater is filling up leave the faucets on so you can bleed all of the air out of the system. The main companies producing such heaters are Bosch, Rheum and Noritz. Tankless water heaters generally require a higher initial investment, but they are less costly to operate and provide additional benefits like endless hot water.</p>
<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
