Having an incorrect setting can cause your water to be too cold, too hot, or cause your heating elements to work constantly. If your tank is gas powered, you'll find gas connections below the tank at the pilot light. The idea behind this type of water heater is to reduce wasted energy by heating the water as it runs through the pipe instead of keeping it in a tank and spending energy to keep it at one temperature twenty four hours a day.</p>
<p>Energy efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water. Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time.
