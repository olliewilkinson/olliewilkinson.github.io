<h2>Water Heater Services Greenville Michigan</h2>
<p>Water is dripping constantly from the rag that you have wrapped around the pin hole in the water pipe. Install an additional tankless water heater to ensure you can always meet demand. Once your water heater stops working, you should know what to do, whether to apply a DIY approach or to go on and call a plumber. When you open a faucet, the released hot water is replaced by incoming cold water, which is heated and stored again at a temperature controlled by one or more thermostats in the tank. Having hot water and heat for your home is a must have.</p>

When you're enjoying quality family time, the last thing you need is a plumbing emergency.</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing. If the water is still as hot as it was before you turned the temperature down, it's because the thermostat isn't working. That's why it's important to regularly maintain and, if necessary, repair your hot water tank — and that's a task that AirPlus Heating & Cooling can assist you with. It is important to know what you have as well as the benefits and disadvantages to making water heater changes, which is why our friendly technicians are here to help.</p>
