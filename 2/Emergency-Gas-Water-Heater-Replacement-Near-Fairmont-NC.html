<h2>Water Heater Services Fairmont North Carolina</h2>
<p>If you are thinking of replacing your gas tank-style unit with a tankless model, you should consider an outdoor installation. An electric water heater has an upper and a lower heating element. Storage tank: Storage tank water heaters typically have a capacity of 30 to 60 gallons, but the most common size is 50 gallons. The disadvantage with this tankless gas heater is that it takes a few seconds before hot water starts flowing. You don't know how old the water heater is or when it was last serviced.

Tankless gas water heaters have wider applications, as they supply hot water at higher flow rates.

<h3>Benefits Of Commercial Plumbing Services Fairmont NC</h3>
<p>Stop suffering from common water heater issues and get help today by calling (408) 963-6896. The energy used to maintain a certain temperature when you are not using the water is often called standby heat loss.

We are knowledgeable local experts in both standard water heater repair and installation as well as tankless water heater installation and repair services.</p>
<p>There's never a good time to run out of hot water—especially if you're halfway through a shower. Single point heaters cost around $150 each and are suitable for areas with smaller capacity demands such as bathroom showers, and they are generally electrically powered. As a rule of thumb, water heaters are not designed to last much beyond about 10 to 15 years (more or less). The "largest" electric tankless heaters can't match the output of a "standard" gas tankless unit.</p>
<p>Electric models run consistently, produce high energy ratings, and are easier to maintain than gas. Electric water heaters are simple to repair usually the elements or the thermostats will need replacement and can be tested and replaced in a short amount of time. We also offer expert installations as well as reliable repair and maintenance services to keep your system working optimally. To begin the installation, temporarily thread the valve into the tank and take a measurement between the bottom of the valve and the floor place.</p>

<p>FYI - Some tankless units, such as those made by Rheem , are able to work with a standard ½-inch gas line, provided it isn't longer than 24 feet. A final thing to consider is the expected time to replacement for the hot water heater. In an instant water heater system, the water is already heated to the set temperature as it travels through the pipes. They heat water directly, delivering a continuous flow so you never run out of hot water.</p>
