Also, test all wires in the water heater with a non-contact voltage tester to confirm the power is off before touching the wires. The water heater is capable of heating nearly 4 gallons per minute in cold weather, or up to 6 gallons during summer months. When you replace a water heater, you are also expected to bring the water heating system up to current building codes While the cost of doing this is not directly part of the cost of the water heater, the two should be calculated together to find an estimate of the total expense.</p>
<p>After many decades of service, we have found Bradford-White and Navien water heaters are the best in the industry. Consult with your local Roto-Rooter plumber to establish a water heater maintenance schedule that will maximize the life of your appliance.

After completing all the connections, the final step is to connect the new water heater to the power supply. Our tankless Installation price includes the job from start to finish along with the removal of old equipment and materials. Next if your heater came with a T&P valve unbox it and pipe dope those threads.</p>

Chances are the clue that tipped you off to your water heater problem was a lack of hot water. With an electric heater, you will need to flip the breaker switch to "off". Also a couple of easy do-it-yourself projects such as insulating hot water pipes and regulating your water heating temperature, can also contribute to saving both money and energy on your water heating.</p>

So that increases the installation cost even further. If you flush your tank heater annually and call for professional service when you experience any operational issues, you will ensure your heater the maximum lifespan. High Energy Bills: Your water heater, particularly if you have a traditional tanked unit, is one of the highest consumers of electricity.</p>
