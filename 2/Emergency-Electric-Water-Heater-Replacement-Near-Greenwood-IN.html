Sometimes, however, even the largest, gas-fired model cannot supply enough hot water for simultaneous, multiple uses in large households.</p>
<p>Because a direct vent water heater has fewer moving parts in it with fewer things to go wrong, it will carry either a 6-, 9- or 12-year warranty, whereas a powered vent water heater will typically cap out at a 6-year warranty.

<p>Thank you AC Plumbing Heating & Air for squeezing me in on a short notice to get my AC serviced. With a conventional water heater you are limited by the amount of hot water it holds.
