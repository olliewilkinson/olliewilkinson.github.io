Whether it be in your commercial business or your home, water heaters are vital across the board. Tankless water heaters are a compact, efficient way to supply hot water to your home.

<p>Gas fittings and electrical connections age and wear out over time as well, all of which can lead to the decision to replace your current water heater. Water heaters that have not been properly installed and inspected can become a fire, explosion and health hazard for your building and occupants. Once we find the issue with your water heater we will be able to repair it then and there. This is because instead of wasting energy keep water warm in a tank, a tankless water heater only heats water as you use it.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement Campbell</h3>
<p>If you have been looking to cut on your energy bills, replacing your old water tank heater and upgrading to a tankless heater is the way to go. Traditional tanks are outdated in every sense of the word; they are bulky, slow, and unreliable in addition to facilitating energy wastage. Our plumbers can inspect and troubleshoot, and also offer maintenance services to help limit the risk of repair issues down the road.</p>
<p>They can cut your water heating bills in half and earn you a nice utility rebate from Duke Energy. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day. Because they use up to 30 to 50 percent less energy, tankless units can save an average family about $100 or more annually, depending on water usage. Regular maintenance is required for a longer life of a water heater.</p>
<p>We serve Los Angeles - Orange County and surrounding Southern California neighborhoods for all your water heater repair and replacement needs. Save money and get easy access to hot water with a tankless water heater installation. A tankless water heater isn't continually working to keep a tank full of water hot. Both tank and tankless units come with a manufacturer's warranty. If your home is space-restricted, you'll have challenges finding enough area to locate storage tank water heaters.</p>
<p>Disconnect the electrical wires on the top of the water heater. What's more, since their introduction in the United States in the 1990s, tankless heaters have become increasingly sophisticated, with features like built-in recirculating pumps (for instant” hot water), and wireless connectivity that tells you via smartphone exactly when a unit needs maintenance. In that scenario the person is left waiting for the tank of water to become heated to the set temperature.</p>
<h3>What To Do During Emergency Plumbing Situations Campbell OH</h3>
<p>A 50 gallon water heater can take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours for electric or 30 to 60 minutes for gas to heat water to 120 degrees. It really depends on the brand you buy, and the cost of the model purchased, but a traditional water heater will last 10 to 13 years, and a tankless water heater will generally last up to 20 years. If the circuit breaker or fuse repeatedly blows out, call a qualified electrician to check and repair the circuit.</p>
<p>Efficiency is the name of the game at Payless Water Heaters, and that efficiency means one thing: less stress for you. If your unit is over 10 years old, constantly leaking, or needing consistent repairs, these could be indicators that call for a hot water heater installation. Also, know it's purpose because if it will only be running a kitchen sink, you can get away with a model that uses less energy and save a good deal of money.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble with your existing water heater, schedule an in-home consultation and let one of our professional, licensed technicians inspect your unit. Tankless water heaters are far more efficient because they do not waste energy keeping water hot when there is no demand for it. Maintaining the temperature of a 50-gallon tank of water takes a lot of gas or electricity that is not needed with the in-demand style of water heaters.</p>
