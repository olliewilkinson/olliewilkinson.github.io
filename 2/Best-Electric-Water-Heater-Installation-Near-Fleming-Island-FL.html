<p>The only bigger percentage is heating and cooling costs. Tankless water heaters are heaters which work dynamically, heating water up as you request it, so no energy gets wasted storing any heated water, there's no bulk since the tankless water heater is just a small box, and you'll have no difficulties concealing it under a sink or behind a piece of furniture for example. We want you to know exactly what we're doing as we do it, both so you can be informed during the installation process and so you can properly maintain and understand your unit after it's installed.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as demand-type or instantaneous water heaters, provide hot water only as it is needed. As shown in the photo, a tankless water heater has its components housed in a steel box that's designed to be mounted on the wall. This means as long as you have water flowing, and don't run out of whatever fuel (propane, electricity, etc.) you use to generate the heat; you have continuous hot water.</p>
