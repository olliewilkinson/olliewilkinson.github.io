<p>Because water heaters are so important to your home's comfort, making sure your system performs at peak levels with as much efficiency as possible is of utmost importance. On top of that, electrical tankless water heaters cost less than most tankless gas units. So if your property does not already have a gas connection, the cost of making this connection will negate any cost savings of a tankless system. For this reason, installation costs will vary based on a home's floor plan and how far the piping needs to be directed through the house.</p>

<p>Positives: Factors In Favor Of installing an electric tankless water heater. Visit the pages on different types of water heaters (linked above) for more on sizing.
