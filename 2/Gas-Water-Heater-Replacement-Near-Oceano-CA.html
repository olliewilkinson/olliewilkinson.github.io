Before you buy, note the stem length required by your water heater model. How they work: Tankless systems heat your water on demand using gas or electric coils. They are also insulated to keep the water hot between heating cycles. It's time to replace your unit.</p>
<p>Tankless usually cost between three and five times as much as a normal water heater for the initial purchase. The problem may be caused by the water heater's main breaker. Endless hot water, additional storage space and lower energy bills are just a few reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters.

Hot water temperatures above 125 degrees Fahrenheit can cause serious burns. If installed properly, your tankless water heater should not require much maintenance and can run for twice as long as a conventional storage (tank) water heater.</p>

<p>Once a new water heater of the proper size has been selected, it needs to be hooked up to the waterline. Hybrid models function like conventional storage tanks, but they use a heat pump to extract energy from the air.

Another advantage is that tankless heaters have a longer life span those ordinary heaters.</p>

Explain what's wrong with your tankless water heater. For gas heaters, you have to detach the vent pipe that is connected to the draft hood.</p>
