<h2>Water Heater Services West Hollywood California</h2>
<p>Installing a tankless gas water heater is a very worthwhile investment and one that will pay for itself in a very short period of time. Without a warranty, you could end up spending a lot more on repairs of an old water heater than you would if you upgraded to a new model. Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed.
