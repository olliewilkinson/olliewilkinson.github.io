A conventional water heater is a large, cylindrical tank with a heat exchanger inside.

<p>Who should buy a tank water heater: If you have a timeline or budget constraints that prevent you from getting a tankless system, a tank heater may be the way to go. If your home runs strictly on electricity, you have to carefully consider whether going tankless is really worth it.

<p>Water heater usage costs $150 to $700 per year. WATER HARDNESS: Scale deposits that form in a heat exchanger (or on electric heating elements) slow down heat transfer and constrict water flow. The plumbing runs from the heat exchanger in the hot water tank, to the expansion tank, up through the solar collectors above, down through the pressure relief system, and then finally back to the heat exchanger in the tank.</p>
<p>In addition to the upfront cost, which carries significant weight in the decision for many, other factors also include the number of people in the house, any remodeling in the home, as well as the expense to operate the heater. If you see a dip in water pressure whenever you turn on your hot water, there may be some damage to the plumbing lines.
