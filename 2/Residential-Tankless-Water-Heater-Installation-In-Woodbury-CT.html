The life expectancy of a water heater is typically eight to twelve years and, here in our area, it will typically be fueled by gas or electric. Follow these steps to install the new water heater. But there is one possibility of resolving these problems once and for all, and that is a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>A tankless water heater uses a heat source (electric or gas) to warm up cool water on-demand whenever you need it rather than storing hot water in a tank.

<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Woodbury CT</h3>
<p>To keep your tankless water heater running like new, you can do a few things yourself - like cleaning the air and in-line water filters - but an annual maintenance service visit is highly recommended.

If you're planning to sell your home in the near future, and you fear your existing water heater may not last, I would consider the lower upfront cost of a conventional one, or at most upgrade (for the improved marketability) to the high-efficiency gas storage water heater, rather than incurring the additional expense of a whole-home tankless gas water heater.</p>
<p>The most efficient storage tank has an energy factor of about67, but according to Energy Star, some tankless units have energy factors as high as95.
