A conventional water heater (tank) can last up to 15 years with proper maintenance. Most gas-powered tankless water heaters do qualify for a $300 federal tax rebate. Water heaters need space to operate safely and an improperly installed unit can be a constant source of danger in your home.</p>
<p>Because tankless water heaters draw water from your main water line only as you need it, there is no possibility of flooding from this kind of system. The only higher percentage is heating and cooling costs. One of the lesser-known downsides of tankless water heaters is that they have difficulty achieving a lukewarm water temperature. For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time might stretch a tankless water heater to its limit.</p>

If there is currently no gas hookup at the house, and one has to be put in to facilitate the new tankless water heater, that will cost extra.</p>

Let PV help you select the best conventional water heater tank for your home and provide a Grade A+ water heater installation. Tankless water heaters make this process much easier. Not only do we offer water heater repair for your home or business, but we also install water heaters, as well.</p>
<p>While you'll usually pay a bit more for longer-warranty models, we've found that they tend to have larger elements or burners that can speed up water heating and have thicker insulation for less heat loss. To prevent this pressure from building up, every water heater uses a relief valve in its construction. Homeowners often ask if a gas water heater or an electric unit is more cost-efficient.
