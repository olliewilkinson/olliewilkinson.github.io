<h2>Water Heater Services Ferndale Washington</h2>
<p>Are you struggling with a broken water heater? Energy efficiency is a good starting point but there are other things we need to look at. Assuming that you are going to go with the more efficient tankless heater the most important pieces of information you need are the climate zone you live in, how many gallons of hot water you expect to use during the most demanding part of the day and how much you would pay for utilities, if you have a choice.</p>
<p>This is because the flow of energy is easier to regulate with an electric connection, plus the pilot light has to be properly ignited with a gas connection. And no tanks means no hot water sitting unused, reducing your overall heating costs by hundreds of dollars. If it's too big, you may be spending more money than necessary to heat up the water within the tank. We keep water heaters stocked at TLC so we can replace your water heater day or night.</p>
<p>Apply heat-resistant silicone sealant to the vent shaft of the water heater, slip on a connector and secure with a hose clamp. Circuit wiring is usually housed in flexible metal cable or conduit where it connects to the water heater. So if the tank you use is well insulated and the boiler you use is highly efficient, this can be the least expensive way to provide hot water for a home's occupants. Using a natural gas rate of $10.86 per 1,000 cubic feet, we calculated that the payback time for converting from a storage tank gas water heater to a gas tankless ranges from 22½ years to 27½ years.</p>

Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
