<h2>Water Heater Services Sunbury Ohio</h2>
<p>If you have been considering buying a new water heater, you might have been told that you need a 50 gallon water heater if you have a family with 3 or 4 members in your household. Traditional water heaters can deliver as much hot water as the pipes will allow all at once. Broken pilot light: If you have a gas water heater, a lack of hot water may signal that its pilot light has gone out. Call the tankless water heater plumbers from Benjamin Franklin Plumbing today at (800) 259-7705 for help. The presence of puddles of water around the heater or water seeping down the sides of the heater are usually signs that the water heater tank may be fractured.</p>

<p>There is no way around it. And this is technology used in these tankless heaters is modern and hi-tech, but they produce one disadvantage that while CO2 emissions are reduced, an acidic condensate is formed.

If your showers have recently started to be ruined by unexpected blasts of cold water, then it's time to call in an expert from The Plumbing & Air Service Co. for quick solutions and trusted water heater installation and repair services you can count on.</p>

We'll consider whether you prefer gas or electric service, how much hot water your property demands, and how much available space you have for a new tank.

<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there. If there is adequate electrical service and room in the breaker panel, electric tankless is a great option. The heating element in the unit heats it up to the temperature that is desired. Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Energy , heating water accounts for about 30 percent of a family's energy bills. They are larger in size compared to the storage tank heaters. When you and your system are ready, we'll oversee the delivery and installation of your new tankless water heater.
