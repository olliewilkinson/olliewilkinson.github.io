<h2>Water Heater Services Fort Wayne Indiana</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>
<p>We don't cut corners and will make sure that you have a hot water tank that meets your needs. If you are looking for scheduled preventive maintenance do not hesitate to reach out to us and one of our professional plumbers will be more than happy to assist you with how we can help your business with scheduled plumbing maintenance. Our plumbers, electricians, and HVAC technicians are some of the highest trained professionals in the industry.</p>
<h3>Local Tankless Water Heater Replacement Fort Wayne</h3>
<p>When your water heater fails, a brand new water heater may be called for, especially if your existing unit is very old. Call Epic Plumbing at (281) 815-2322 to schedule an appointment for professional tankless water heater repair and installation services in Pearland. Yes, some problems with water heaters can be repaired but not all. This cuts down on the water heater's efficiency and its ability to adequately heat the water.</p>
<p>Check out the most common problems to determine if a water heater repair or replacement is right for you. Electric water heater: Turn off the circuit breaker on the water heater's circuit at the home's breaker box. Tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, produce hot water only when you need it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when used in homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water each day, according to They also last about double the amount of time as long as a tank water heater.</p>
<p>Call now and we'll be there soon to help you get your hot water back on and to alleviate your worries about your water heater. Your local Aire Serv technician can help you determine whether your water heater is a suitable candidate for repair or replacement. Check the water heater wiring with a voltage detector to make sure that the unit is off. The gas connection is the piping that connects to your existing gas service, which will be extended to your heater.</p>
<p>Consequently, the exhaust vent can be PVC or polypropylene and not metal, a feature that can lower the cost of installation. Our trained and certified plumbers will provide you with an honest, upfront price on the cost to install a tankless water heater ($29 or FREE if you choose us to install your water heater). For safety reasons, the water heater should not be on air conditioning lines or under pipes that can drip.</p>
<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Fort Wayne IN</h3>
<p>Petersen Plumbing does not recommend tankless water heaters in locations with hard well water, or where galvanized steel pipe is present either in the building, or in the water service to the building. Capacity: The size of on-demand water heaters should be based on the number of occupants in the home and their peak hour water demand, rather than the size of the house. Units that undergo routine checks and upgrades last longer and undergo less frequent and costly repairs.</p>
<p>If your water heater is in a location that will cause damage to your home, you should strongly consider replacing it after 10 years (or before, if any of the following symptoms occur). With a gas heater turn the thermostat knob to the pilot setting. Tankless heaters provide continuous hot water, so gone are the days of the hot water running out mid-shower. Inadequate Water Flow: Another thing to be aware of is that if minerals build up in the tankless water heater, they can cause slow water flow from faucets and taps.</p>
<p>You don't want to schedule annual maintenance for a tankless water heater, whereas a hot water tank can function without annual maintenance. First of all, installing a tankless water heater is a very complex method, so you should call a plumber to get it fixed. If the pilot light goes out after you light it, click the high-limit reset switch (sometimes called a door switch), located down by the viewing door at the bottom of the water tank.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Fort Wayne Indiana 46835</h3>
<p>Water heater usage costs $150 to $700 per year. WATER HARDNESS: Scale deposits that form in a heat exchanger (or on electric heating elements) slow down heat transfer and constrict water flow. The plumbing runs from the heat exchanger in the hot water tank, to the expansion tank, up through the solar collectors above, down through the pressure relief system, and then finally back to the heat exchanger in the tank.</p>
<p>The further your water has to travel from the water heater to its destination, the more noticeable the gap. He will also show you the easy way to carry a water heater out of your home, even if you are working alone. Tankless water heaters can be installed on walls, in garages, or outdoors using an anti-freeze kit. Also, as I mentioned earlier, tank-style heaters break down over time due to hard water causing the inner lining of the tank to rust and corrode.</p>
<p>Before purchasing a tankless water heater, you will need to determine your hot water usage, which is measured in gallons per minute (GPM), and figure out your maximum hot water demand. Whether you go with an electric tankless unit or a gas one, you will save money on your utility bills. In some cases, a tankless water heater is located in a completely different location than the old water heater. If you have a tankless coil water heater, and you heat with oil, follow steps for "no heat." If you have a gas hot water tank, do not reset breaker or re-light pilot.</p>
<p>It will also take a long time for the water you need to heat up, since it only starts to do so when you turn on a tap. While the water heater is filling up leave the faucets on so you can bleed all of the air out of the system. The main companies producing such heaters are Bosch, Rheum and Noritz. Tankless water heaters generally require a higher initial investment, but they are less costly to operate and provide additional benefits like endless hot water.</p>
<p>While a traditional tank costs anywhere from $300 to $600 (not including installation costs), most tankless units cost at least $700 and can vary widely in price from there. We'll come out to assess your tankless unit and identify the root cause. First and foremost, take a look at your water heater's thermostat. If you need water heater replacement, we'll talk you through all your available options. The telltale sign that your water heater needs replacing is a slow drip underneath, usually showing up as a trail of rusty water.</p>
