<h2>Water Heater Services Ballston Spa New York</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>Energy efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water. Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time. Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits. You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>

<h3>Hot Water Heater Replacement Ballston Spa</h3>
<p>Often times newer and larger water heaters will not fit in this space, because they have more insulation than they used. Almost all water heater manufacturers recommend a complete burner replacement in the event of flooding. Whether you have a clogged toilet, a leaky faucet, or reduced water flow that needs immediate attention, sometimes professional service is needed. We realize the cost effects of outdated technology on your energy bills and we can help you upgrade to an efficient design that helps you save costs.</p>

Propane water heaters are easily to install as they don't take too much space. But a Rinnai tankless gas water heater heats water as it goes through the pipes, giving you endless hot water for your home or business. The first thing to check if you have a gas water heater and no hot water is whether or not you have gas.</p>
<p>They are called tankless as they heat up water only during the times you turn on your hot water tap. If your water heater is nearing the end of its useful life and you're thinking of replacing it before disaster strikes, you'll be happy to know that you have better choices, thanks to recent federal regulations that require water heaters to be more energy-efficient. Since tankless models heat water on demand, they usually end up heating a lower volume of water for less time when compared to conventional water heaters.</p>
<p>Instead you'll have to remove the metal thermostat cover on the side of the water heater, pull out the insulation and hold the tester near the wires leading into the top of the high-temperature cutoff switch (see Figure A). Tankless units take about 15 seconds to bring water up to temperature, but you still have to wait for that hot water to arrive at your shower head or faucet, just as you do with a tank-type heater.</p>
