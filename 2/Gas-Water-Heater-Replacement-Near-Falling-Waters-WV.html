<h2>Water Heater Services Falling Waters West Virginia</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>The tankless hot water heater will heat the water as it goes through the heat exchanger, which is activated by the incoming water as it flows through. Gas water heaters require gas lines that provide fuel to the ignition system and burner. If you are not experienced in maintaining a water heater, it is best to bring in a plumber to maintain it annually. Your perfect water heater will differ depending on your hot water expectations, your budget, and the layout of your home.</p>
<p>It might seem like it would be easy to install a water heater, but it is actually a lot more complex than it looks.
