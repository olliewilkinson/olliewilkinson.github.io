<p>Circuit breaker for an electric heater trips. Tankless water heaters are perfect for vacation and second homes that are not constantly occupied. Tankless water heaters also use gas to heat water; however, tankless systems heat water on demand instead of expending energy maintaining a full tank of hot water. The water inside of a tankless water heater is less likely to rust. This kind of heater can deliver a nearly endless source of hot water, because it's always heating a big amount of water.</p>
<p>If you know the different types of water heaters available in the market, it is easier to make the right decision when purchasing one.

We'll come out to assess your tankless unit and identify the root cause. First and foremost, take a look at your water heater's thermostat. If you need water heater replacement, we'll talk you through all your available options.
