<h2>Water Heater Services Rochester Michigan</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>In spite of all benefits, water heaters go down due to various reasons. But if you need to have hot water supply in your bathroom, then you may need a larger unit for this.

<p>Because it's constantly heating and reheating water throughout the day. Heating your water can consume a lot of energy. Water heaters should be serviced regularly in order to preserve their functionality, and repairs may be necessary after substantial use or as the heater grows older, however, they simply don't last forever.
