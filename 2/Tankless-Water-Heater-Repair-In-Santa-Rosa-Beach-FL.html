<p>This is especially true for those units that have gone without proper maintenance or repairs when needed. That's 2X the life of a traditional hot water heater. When long-term costs matter, the electric tankless water heater is the most cost-effective option, but is not the most efficient fuel source. Gas or electric demand units average about the same cost to purchase. Each type of water heater has their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>For residential applications, the hot water set point temperature should be only slightly above the highest temperature needed for domestic uses. A lot of times when this happens, its because the necessary repairs and maintenance were not scheduled for your water heater. Since the issue just started after you installed the tankless water heater, I would highly recommend calling the water heater company and asking them to come to take a look.</p>
<p>Sometimes, your water heater will give you signs that it's struggling before it dies. Installing the temperature controls can be tricky if you aren't familiar with them, so make sure you read the instructions regarding this part of installation as well.
