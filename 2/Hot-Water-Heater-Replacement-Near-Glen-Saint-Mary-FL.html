<h2>Water Heater Services Glen Saint Mary Florida</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>Highly efficient water heaters such as tankless coil and indirect ones use less energy than conventional units, saving homeowners money on their utility bills in the long run. Hot water can add up to 25% of your energy bill, so be sure to choose an energy efficient heating appliance. These signs could mean that it's time to look into water heater repair. While a tankless water heater can provide an unlimited amount of hot water, it can only provide a limited volume.</p>

Another one of the advantages that comes along with using a tankless water heater is that it lasts a lot longer than your standard water heater.

Having tankless heater in your house produces endless supply of hot water.</p>

<p>Tankless water heaters are not a simple swap out.” Most conventional gas water heaters were not installed with a tankless retrofit in mind. No storage tank saves valuable space.
