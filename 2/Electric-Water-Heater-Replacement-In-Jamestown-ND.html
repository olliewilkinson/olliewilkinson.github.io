<p>If your family has grown larger or smaller, this is a good time to consider upsizing or downsizing your water heater. A traditional water heater stores hot water in a large tank. You'll need to have the water heater cleaned out, but we also strongly recommend installing a water softener to eliminate the problem at the source. With tankless electric water heaters, there is a direct relationship between the flow rate of a fixture (demand), the power supplied to the tankless electric water heater, and the output temperature of the hot water.</p>
<p>Although still an efficient enough way to heat water, some of the problems cited with these storage tank water heaters include the heated water limits, the heating delays and maintenance problems.

A Direct Vent water heater is similar to a standard water heater in configuration. Self-cleaning units automatically fight lime and sediment buildup to lengthen tank life and maintain peak efficiency for a longer period.

Turn on the cold water supply valve to the water heater and turn on the water supply valve (or the house water supply, as applicable). Traditional storage water tank heaters, also known as "boilers" are the most common water heaters installed for the last 120 years or so and are used for central heating and can also heat the water for your home using steam.</p>

Your water heater works hard day and night to keep your family warm and comfortable from the time you wake up and take a shower, to the time you wash your face and get ready for a good nights sleep.</p>
<p>Most modern tankless water heaters operate in the range of 11,000 to 199,000 BTUs per hour. If you're planning to sell your home in the near future, and you fear your existing water heater may not last, I would consider the lower upfront cost of a conventional one, or at most upgrade (for the improved marketability) to the high-efficiency gas storage water heater, rather than incurring the additional expense of a whole-home tankless gas water heater.</p>
