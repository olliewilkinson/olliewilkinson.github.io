<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Replacement Coldwater</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters have several advantages over traditional tank-style water heaters. That is why here at Marc Francis Plumbing, we understand how problematic it can be when our water heaters stop working due to old age, leaks, or any other problems you may be experiencing. Some send the unit back others go ahead and install the tank realizing that for the most part the dents are cosmetic and as long as the glass liner is not damaged the water heater will work fine.</p>
<p>Combining the higher hot water output of a tank heater with the limitless heating capacity of tankless, ENERGY STAR-certified hybrid or heat pump water heaters often pay for themselves in under two years. For many water heater repairs, it makes a difference whether the water heater is gas or electric. Electric models do not produce greenhouse gases.

<p>When your water heater breaks down, you want to call someone you can trust. Accordingly, the best place to install a tankless system is directly next to the water fixture. For a simple install with no need to run additional gas lines to a new hookup, an install will take an average of around 3-4 hours for a total installation cost of $150-$600. Over time, even well-maintained water heaters will begin to lose efficiency and develop more problems associated with wear and tear.</p>

<p>Let us install your tankless water heater and keep your plumbing running smoothly. Gas is fed to the burner through a gas control valve and thermostat switch that are usually located toward the bottom of the hot water storage tank.
