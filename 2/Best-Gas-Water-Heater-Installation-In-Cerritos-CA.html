<h2>Water Heater Services Cerritos California</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>From standard tank water heaters to tankless to solar water heaters, we offer a solution that will meet your needs and conserve energy. This means that you might need a larger unit or multiple units if you have a simultaneous demand from multiple showers, faucets, or other hot water consumers like a washing machine.

<p>With hot water pipes adequately insulated with materials like foam pipe insulation sleeves, your plumber can help your home become more energy efficient.

Typically, tankless water heaters provide hot water at a rate of 2-5 gallons (7.6-15.2 liters) per minute. If your electric hot water heater is slow to heat, runs out of hot water faster than it used to, or doesn't deliver any hot water at all, there's a 90 percent chance that simply replacing one or both of the heating elements will solve the problem.</p>
