<p>Petri Plumbing & Heating, Inc. Tankless water heaters heat only the water you use, rather than heating and storing water continuously. That being said, although it is a simple process, dealing with gas or electricity and water should always be handled by a professional.

<p>When you wake up to take your shower only to find that your hot water is gone, call us for water heater repair in Dallas, TX right away. Tankless water heaters Wall-mounted tankless units heat water on demand, only heating as much as is required for your needs.

<p>Save money, improve efficiency of your heating system with our professional water heater and tankless water heater installation and repair services. They do require a storage tank, unlike conventional tankless water heaters, but because an indirect heater uses the boiler or main furnace to heat the fluid circulated through a heat exchanger in the storage tank, the energy that's actually "stored" by the tank lets the furnace turn off and on less frequently.</p>
<p>They are smaller than conventional storage heaters, are wall mounted and do not take up floor space. Common problems you can expect to experience include low gas pressure, a low heating capacity, or rusty-looking water. Make sure when you call a plumber you call a licensed plumber that is experienced in repairing tankless water heaters. Also, contact your city or town for information about obtaining a permit, if necessary, and about local water heater installation codes.</p>
<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there. If there is adequate electrical service and room in the breaker panel, electric tankless is a great option. The heating element in the unit heats it up to the temperature that is desired. Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>
