<h2>Water Heater Services Bellingham Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Water Heaters are a necessary household appliance that supplies all of your warm water needs, from cooking to bathing. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more often. We also want enough hot water for our needs and energy costs savings. Many people don't know much about water heaters or water heater repairs. A well-maintained tankless water heater can last for a long time. Typical anticipated lifetimes for these water heaters are 8-12 years for conventional and 10-15 years for high-efficiency.</p>
<p>This is because the flow of energy is easier to regulate with an electric connection, plus the pilot light has to be properly ignited with a gas connection. And no tanks means no hot water sitting unused, reducing your overall heating costs by hundreds of dollars. If it's too big, you may be spending more money than necessary to heat up the water within the tank. We keep water heaters stocked at TLC so we can replace your water heater day or night.</p>
<p>Many people think that electric hot water heaters are very expensive, and there are commercials seen often that indicate that gas water heaters are a better choice because they cost less and they keep working when the power goes out. A broken unit can quickly leave you without any hot water, which is why it's good to know what warning signs to look for to get timely repair services. These replacement models have been designed to save on running costs by having no fixed pilot.</p>

<p>Doctor Water Heater also provides tankless water heater installation and maintenance. In many cases, existing piping must be extended or relocated, and for a gas unit, a safe vent must be installed to prevent carbon monoxide from accumulating inside the home.

Cycling losses - the loss of heat as the water circulates through a water heater tank, or inlet and outlet pipes.</p>
<p>Tankless can also be a good choice for large families because you have more people consistently using more hot water. There are many reasons why these are much better than the tank heaters, but let's consider the most important reasons to switch over, money.

The initial cost of a combination or integrated water and space heating system is going to cost you more than if you install a separate heater and furnace or boiler, but both installation and maintenance costs are probably going to be less.</p>
<p>At Delk Plumbing, Inc., we only work with the best, ensuring you can enjoy long-term performance with lower energy costs. Best performance comes from gas units, as electric units are not Energy Star-rated. Many homeowners in our area are choosing to switch to a tankless water heater for many reasons.

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
<p>When you need a new tankless water heater installed, your first task should be to select a reliable plumbing company who will provide you with free written price quotes, a history of reliability and integrity, a connection to your community, and a dedication to customer service and satisfaction. The peak hour demand or first-hour rating (FHR) is the measure of how much hot water the heater will deliver in an hour, and the FHR is required by law to appear on the Energy Guide label.</p>

If using a single point unit, you want the unit fairly close to where the hot water will be used in order to deliver the water in a timely way. Storage tank water heaters are commonly found in most homes. Connect the shutoff valve and the sediment trap to the water heater following the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
<p>These are all symptoms of a failing water tank, and if you catch them early enough, you can avoid total failure by calling a hot water maintenance company for help. We suggest reading up on our Advantage Program to potentially avoid problems with your water heater. Keep in mind, however, that as a trusted water heater contractor, our most important goal when working on your project is to do it correctly, instead of quickly.</p>

These only allow you hot water from one outlet at a time. Tankless water heaters are manufactured with energy-efficiency feature as a priority. Since tankless water heaters work by heating water from the external source on-demand, you could take a shower for 10 hours (or longer), and the water would be as hot as it would be for a 10-minute shower.</p>
