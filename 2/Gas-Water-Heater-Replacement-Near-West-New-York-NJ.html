A common misconception is that a water heater which has stopped functioning has to be replaced. With these units, you don't have to ever worry about a rusted tank that leaks. The power source for a tankless water heater needs to be readily accessible in the area where the tank is installed. Many people choose to simply use the same type that they are using presently, while others are influenced by the purchase price, the cost of running the heater over time, how energy efficient they are and how long it takes for the water to heat.</p>

Over time, even well-maintained water heaters will begin to lose efficiency and develop more problems associated with wear and tear.</p>

The tankless heater compared to a conventional heater has unlimited hot water and can deliver for hours not limited by the tank's capacity. When you turn the hot water tap in a home with a tankless water heater, a powerful gas or electric heater kicks on and instantly heats water running through coils in the unit.</p>
