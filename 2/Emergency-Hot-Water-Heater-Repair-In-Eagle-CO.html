<h2>Water Heater Services Eagle Colorado</h2>
<p>Buying a tankless gas water heater is quite an investment, so being able to install it yourself will help reduce some of the price. Remember that online and in person salespeople are typically not water heating professionals. If line voltage is found, wait for water to heat or perform the Ohms (or Resistance) checks on the elements once more with the power off. Enjoy hot water more regularly during the day, without worrying about the utility bill going up. With a proper-sized system on your home, you should notice the hot water heater running much less often—and you should see a reduction on your next utility bill, too.</p>
<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work. The age is also going to be affected by how much this water heater is used, as more wear and tear can cause the product to age faster. Old hot water heaters have parts that are worn. Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>
<p>This is a type of heater that provides hot water only as it is needed. In order for the top element to have voltage and heat the water, the temperature of the water in the top of the tank must be lower than the temperature setting of the top thermostat. Tankless gas models need to produce very high combustion temperatures so that they can instantaneously raise the temperature of incoming cold water to the desired temperature.</p>

<p>Instead, it uses powerful heating elements to heat the water as it flows through the pipes. A tankless unit only works when you need it, cutting down on your costs considerably. With reduced energy usage, reduced water consumption, less sewage, and an on demand system, tankless water heaters are a green alternative to hot water tanks. Beacon Plumbing specializes in replacing old water heaters or repairing them.</p>
<p>Although there is an increasing number of homeowners who have successfully installed a tankless water heater themselves, manufacturers strongly encourage buyers not to. First and foremost, there is the issue of safety. Take a look at your current gas heater and notice the vent hood which is slightly above the top of the heater. The longer lifetime of tankless models means homeowners incur less expense repairing and replacing the water heater.</p>

A typical lifespan for a Rinnai water heater is 20 plus years in a residential location and this is almost twice as long as a tank. A conventional tank constantly heats stored water, is good for high usage demands and is economical. Plumbers must get a special certification in order to perform gas plumbing services, and the average homeowner simply doesn't have the knowledge to do these tasks safely.</p>
<p>Most tankless water heaters can be repaired and have parts exchanged as well, so replacing the entire water heater every 6-8 years is a thing of the past. In the case of the gas tankless water heater installation you are required to have a PVC vent installed that penetrates the roof of your home or that you mount it on the outside of the home and purchase a special outdoor tankless water heater which may also require an enclosure and re-working your water supply lines.</p>
