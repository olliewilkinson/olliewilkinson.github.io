A tankless hot water heater is a heating element installed near the point of use.

<p>Conventional hot water heaters keep water in storage tanks at a set temperature and distribute hot water on an as-needed basis. Replace your standard water heater with an electric fired tankless water heater. Normally, gas-type water heater last up to 12 years. Hot water temperatures above 125 degrees Fahrenheit can cause serious burns.

<p>Since there is no tank to fill and refill, tankless water heaters give you an endless supply of hot water, so it doesn't matter how many people are using it at any given time. On-Demand Tankless Hot Water Heaters have been gaining popularity as home and business owners have become more concerned with energy costs. Once the gas and water are off, and the water heater is drained, you can rest easy that the you will not have to deal with untold amounts of damage and concentrate on repairing or replacing the water heater.</p>
<p>As a water heater ages, sediment will build up on the bottom of the tank. When having an electric tankless water heater installed by a professional, be aware of the electrical service requirements, the additional wires needed for installation, and your home's climate. Pick up the water heater and hang it on the slots. Electric tankless heaters are 99 percent efficient. One other thing you can do when you install or service a water heater to make your life easier is to go ahead and replace the cheesy, plastic drain valve.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Aspen Colorado 81611</h3>
<p>A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). Now that you've read up on how to drain your water heater, be sure the gas is turned off at the valve, not just at the control module. VIP Plumbing's prompt, courteous, and professional service technicians will fix all of your plumbing problems, and put your mind at ease. Because the old style had a tank full of water, every time the water in the tank drops below a certain temperature, the heating element turns on, heating the water back up, even if you aren't using it. With an inline heater, it only comes on when in use, and when you aren't using the hot water, the unit shuts off until needed again.</p>
<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
<p>Some homeowners find that local building codes have changed and that after their water heater is repaired, upgrades to the venting system, drain pan and other components are needed. Electric water heaters typically last a year or two longer than gas models, but not always. They also tend to have many fewer problems with them than other types of water heating systems. If you need your water heater replaced, we're up for the task.</p>
<p>It's much more convenient to shop for a replacement water heater around the 10-year or 15-year mark, depending on what type of water heater you have. No need to worry, give us a call right away and we can find the solution to any of your issues with your water heater. Speaking of, you should absolutely have your new tankless water heater installed by a professional. Low water pressure is a typical problem with tankless water heaters and is usually caused by running too many hot water appliances at one time.</p>
<p>Because it's constantly heating and reheating water throughout the day. Heating your water can consume a lot of energy. Water heaters should be serviced regularly in order to preserve their functionality, and repairs may be necessary after substantial use or as the heater grows older, however, they simply don't last forever. Heaters can switch off if there is low water pressure, so the minimum flow rate specification is important here and it has limited capacity for heating.</p>
