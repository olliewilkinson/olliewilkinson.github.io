<h2>Water Heater Services Winchendon Massachusetts</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>Improve your home's water and energy consumption with a tankless water heater. Endless hot water: Because tankless water heaters produce hot water on demand, your supply never runs out. Gas hot water heaters have changed over the years as now most of them have a igniter for lighting the pilot and a gas valve with built in diagnostics. Many homes have galvanized steel or plastic (CPVC) water supply pipes. As time goes on, your water heater naturally starts to fill itself with sediment at the bottom of the tank.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters also known as Instant hot water heaters, do not store water. You may want to have another gas shutoff valve installed just prior to the unit being installed. If your plumbing or electrical system requires upgrading to permit the use of a tankless heater it can be extremely expensive. Water heaters are not simple appliances. This can add to the your water heater cost. This means that it will take much longer for your water to get hot while you run the faucet waiting for it. It's pretty clear that this will cause an increase in water being run down the drain, costing the home owner money, wasting one of our most precious resources.</p>

If your water heater was in storage closet, then you will be able to use this space for other things, such as household items and clothing.</p>

<p>Older water heaters that use a tank can be quite large and take up a lot of space. The colder the incoming water the more heat the heater has to create.
