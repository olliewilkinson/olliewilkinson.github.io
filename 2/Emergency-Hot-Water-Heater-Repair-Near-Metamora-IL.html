In most cases, a person is going to notice that there are small signs that the water heater is getting ready to fail before it completely quits.</p>

<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger and deliver it directly to your faucets or shower without storing it in a tank. Another reason that hot water customers prefer the tankless system is for safety purposes.
