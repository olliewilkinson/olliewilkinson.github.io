<h2>Water Heater Services Lake City South Carolina</h2>
<p>If you are thinking of replacing your gas tank-style unit with a tankless model, you should consider an outdoor installation. An electric water heater has an upper and a lower heating element. Storage tank: Storage tank water heaters typically have a capacity of 30 to 60 gallons, but the most common size is 50 gallons. The disadvantage with this tankless gas heater is that it takes a few seconds before hot water starts flowing. You don't know how old the water heater is or when it was last serviced. If all of these advantages sound good to you, call us today at 423-718-7342 for tankless water heater installation services.</p>
<p>Your water heater is your last defense for dealing with freezing cold water, which is why you should always stay on top of regular maintenance and care. Whether it's powered by electricity or natural gas, your water heater isn't built to last forever. Once the system is all hooked up and properly tested, you're ready to start using your new water heating system. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that in homes using 41 gallons or less of hot water, on-demand tankless units can conserve between 24% to 34% more energy than tank water heaters.</p>
<p>The maintenance necessary for your water heater depends on location, design of the unit, quality of installation, water quality, and manufacturer recommendations. You usually notice a leak when there is a puddle around the bottom of the water heater or they may be a trail leading back to the tank. Note: Unless the water heater stopped working more than a few hours ago, the water spilling out will be hot. Instead of storing heated water in tank, it supplies water only when needed.</p>

<p>Once a new water heater of the proper size has been selected, it needs to be hooked up to the waterline. Hybrid models function like conventional storage tanks, but they use a heat pump to extract energy from the air. With a replacement, you can have a water heater that doesn't require frequent repairs, and you can have a more energy efficient water heater. Another advantage is that tankless heaters have a longer life span those ordinary heaters.</p>
<p>This soon eats up a lot of energy and eventually raises your electric and gas bills. Poorly installed electric wires can suddenly overheat and burn down your home. There is most likely a malfunction in your water heater and a replacement should be considered. There's no reason not to.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Lake City South Carolina 29560</h3>
<p>When you wake up to take your shower only to find that your hot water is gone, call us for water heater repair in Dallas, TX right away. Tankless water heaters Wall-mounted tankless units heat water on demand, only heating as much as is required for your needs. It's important to keep in mind the amount of water that can be heated via a tankless system (0.5 to 2 gallons per minute for a single point heater and 5 - 10 gallons per minute for a whole house unit).</p>
<p>Most homeowners have conventional water heaters that come with a tank where hot water is stored. Replacement of the anode rod: To prevent water from corroding the inside of the tank, a water heater includes a sacrificial” anode rod—a long piece of metal that the water eats away at instead of the tank walls. Another problem is that once this set amount of water runs out you have to wait until the tank reheats more water.</p>
<p>Before purchasing a tankless water heater, you will need to determine your hot water usage, which is measured in gallons per minute (GPM), and figure out your maximum hot water demand. Whether you go with an electric tankless unit or a gas one, you will save money on your utility bills. In some cases, a tankless water heater is located in a completely different location than the old water heater. If you have a tankless coil water heater, and you heat with oil, follow steps for "no heat." If you have a gas hot water tank, do not reset breaker or re-light pilot.</p>

No need to worry, give us a call right away and we can find the solution to any of your issues with your water heater. Speaking of, you should absolutely have your new tankless water heater installed by a professional. Low water pressure is a typical problem with tankless water heaters and is usually caused by running too many hot water appliances at one time.</p>
<p>Gas units are available in a large variety of models and sizes for both home and commercial use and range in output from 130,000 to 380,000 BTUs. Another very common water heater repair issue is no hot water. First, check the water heater's circuit breaker in the service panel to make sure it hasn't tripped. The first question when shopping for a new water heater is whether you want to go with a tank or tankless model.</p>
