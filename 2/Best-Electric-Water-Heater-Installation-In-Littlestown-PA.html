<h2>Water Heater Services Littlestown Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Although water heaters typically last for a number of years, they do need to be replaced from time to time. A tankless water heater is an excellent option for modern homes: they can keep up with the demand of the majority of households (provided they're sized correctly), cut down on energy bills, and won't run out of hot water the way standard storage tank water heaters do. We are proud to offer top quality installations of tankless water heaters in Bethesda, MD and throughout our wide service area. I don't think there's a best” time to buy a new water heater, but as with any appliance, around major holidays (Labor Day, Memorial Day, etc.) are usually good times.</p>
<p>This is because the flow of energy is easier to regulate with an electric connection, plus the pilot light has to be properly ignited with a gas connection. And no tanks means no hot water sitting unused, reducing your overall heating costs by hundreds of dollars. If it's too big, you may be spending more money than necessary to heat up the water within the tank. We keep water heaters stocked at TLC so we can replace your water heater day or night.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters (such as demand-type water heaters and tankless coil water heaters) prevent standby heat losses. When you multiply that usage by each household member, the demands placed on the water heater is brought into perspective. Small families and studio apartments can often use a 20 gallon electric or tankless water heater (if the apartments are on individual units). When it comes to water heaters, repair isn't always the most cost-effective option.</p>
