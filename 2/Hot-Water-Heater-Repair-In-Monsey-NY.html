<p>If you need professional water heater installation or replacement, you have come to the right place. Also, test all wires in the water heater with a non-contact voltage tester to confirm the power is off before touching the wires. The water heater is capable of heating nearly 4 gallons per minute in cold weather, or up to 6 gallons during summer months. When you replace a water heater, you are also expected to bring the water heating system up to current building codes While the cost of doing this is not directly part of the cost of the water heater, the two should be calculated together to find an estimate of the total expense.</p>
<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>You'll also need assistance because water heaters are heavy and bulky, making them difficult to handle. With a tankless unit in place, you can rest assured knowing the system will provide clean and fresh water to your faucets. Most standard tankless water heaters have a lifespan of up to 20 years when properly maintained. Discolored water observed when hot water is coming out of your faucet, is a sign of excess scale built up inside your heater tank.</p>

Replacing the anode rod regularly will significantly increase the life span of the water heater. Popular water heater brands are popular because of their reputation, and brands vary in price. Consequently, a tankless water heater is able to deliver as much instant hot water as you need and not a drop more.</p>
