<p>Essential, the pressure relief valve protects the water heater against possible overpressure. Because of the way that tankless water heaters heat water, you can often end up with a slug of cold water when hot water is turned on, off, then on again.

<p>Initial Cost - Tank heaters are cheaper to purchase and typically less expensive to install. However, f you use more hot water daily (around 86 gallons or more), then you may only get to enjoy an additional 8-10% energy efficiency. With sediment piling up on the bottom of your tank, your water heater is trying to heat water through the mound of dirt, leading to a longer wait time for your water to heat. If your water heater malfunctions, the first step is to turn off both the power and water supply to the water heater to prevent further damage.</p>
<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions. With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason.

<p>If your water system has a check valve or anti-siphon valve on the supply line, an expansion tank near the cold intake to the heater will likely be necessary. Most smaller units are installed near the point of usage, usually on the wall. Overall, the tankless gas water heaters are not as dangerous to life as the comparable standard tank-type units, although nothing is ever 100% assured. Don't think that your heater will continue to function perfectly for many decades, regardless of how modern and expensive yours is. Hot water heater can go for many years without needing repair, but they always eventually malfunction and need fixing or replacing.</p>
