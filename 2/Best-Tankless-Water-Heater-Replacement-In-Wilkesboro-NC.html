<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>The Temperature and Pressure Relief Valve (TPR) is an essential water heater safety feature. Replacing your water heater with a new, more efficient one, could lower your high energy bills. Turn on a faucet, and there it is. When it runs out, it has to consume energy to bring new water up to temperature. While they're picking up the new one, tell them to slap some flexible pipe connections on your credit card, too, in case your new water heater's dimensions aren't the same as the old one's.</p>
<p>These heaters are useful in residences as well as commercial establishments, and can be used in single and multiple unit set ups. A good quality water heater not only reduces the repair and maintenance charges but also acts as an energy saver. Gravity fed water heaters meet the water flow rate requirements and do not require a water efficient shower head or flow restrictor to be installed. It is important to understand that a plugged temperature and pressure relief valve on your water heater can turn your water heater into a dangerous time bomb.</p>
