With routine maintenance, you can avoid having to repair your water heater, and it will last much longer.

If your water heater is nearing the end of its useful life and you're thinking of replacing it before disaster strikes, you'll be happy to know that you have better choices, thanks to recent federal regulations that require water heaters to be more energy-efficient.

When it comes time to replace your old water heater, there are a lot of different options on the maket.

<h3>Do's And Don'ts Of Emergency Plumbing Troubles Midland TX</h3>
<p>Once a new water heater of the proper size has been selected, it needs to be hooked up to the waterline. Hybrid models function like conventional storage tanks, but they use a heat pump to extract energy from the air. With a replacement, you can have a water heater that doesn't require frequent repairs, and you can have a more energy efficient water heater. Another advantage is that tankless heaters have a longer life span those ordinary heaters.</p>
<p>Check for leaks by turning on the gas supply valve and brushing a soapy water solution onto the gas union and all gas joints. Not only are they highly efficient, but they can also save you money by heating water only on-demand. Used for decades in Europe where living space is at a premium, tankless water heaters are a safe and reliable way to use less energy. What can go wrong: A single tankless heater may not have sufficient capacity to supply hot water to multiple locations at the same time.</p>

For example, the Stiebel Eltron Tempra 36 measures about 14x36x5 inches and may be installed just about anywhere you will find proper electrical and plumbing connections.
