<p>It's hard to believe it, but over 19,000 water heaters are replaced every day. Most conventional natural-draft water heaters vent exhaust completely different than any tankless water heater, and though they are a fuel burning appliance, they do need power to operate.

Kids won't be attracted to the inviting spigot, since the unit looks more like a computer than a hot water processor.

They cost more up front than standard electric models, but use about 60% less energy, meaning homeowners tend to see a return on their investment in the form of lower energy bills. If it's time to replace your conventional water heater with something better, a tankless unit might be the perfect choice.</p>
<p>Depending on your household size and personal energy-saving goals, a tankless water heater may be right for you. It is never recommended that you attempt to replace a gas or electric water heater if you are not specifically trained to do so. Improper installation of water heaters may cause fire or explosion. Knowing when your tankless water heater is malfunctioning or damaged will give you the knowledge to call for repairs at the right time.</p>
<p>In your specific case, this may require a larger gas line or a much larger electric supply than what is currently running to your water heater location. Only gas can produce enough hot water for a large home. Contact us anytime you think your water heater needs repair service. If you're not getting hot water, it could be the heating element or another maintenance issue.

<p>That means we know how to quickly and reliably provide tankless water heater repair service no matter what type of problem your hot water heater has. We can also recommend a preventive maintenance plan that will keep your water heater in working order. As the water flows across the heating elements, it gets hot.

Another very common water heater repair issue is no hot water. First, check the water heater's circuit breaker in the service panel to make sure it hasn't tripped. The first question when shopping for a new water heater is whether you want to go with a tank or tankless model.</p>
