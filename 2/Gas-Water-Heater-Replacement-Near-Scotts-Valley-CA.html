We sell a complete line of gas and electric hot water heaters from top manufacturers like Rheem, Bradford White, Bosch, State, Reliance, Noritz and A. Smith.

A properly installed tankless heater can certainly save a large amount of energy over a traditional water heater. A cold shower is a sure sign that your Gwinn home needs water heater maintenance.</p>

<h3>Local Hot Water Heater Replacement Scotts Valley</h3>
<p>If your water comes out smelling like rotten eggs, there could be bacteria in the hot water heater tank. In our Chicago climate we experience extremely cold weather that can occasionally cause a main water line or incorrectly installed tankless water heater to freeze and prevent water from flowing. However, tankless water heaters are more energy efficient because you're only heating water as you need it. A water heater with a tank needs energy to heat up to 100 gallons, for example, and then needs energy to keep it hot all day long or until it's used.</p>
<p>It should be able to provide enough hot water during the busiest time of usage. And a popular fuel choice for this type of water heater is natural gas. By combining a tankless heater and a hot water demand system you get the best of both green worlds, reduced energy consumption and heavy duty water savings. We are happy to replace your troubled water heater with a new unit that is fully warranted and serviced by Mike Diamond Services.</p>

Water heaters can break and leak for various reasons but some of the main problems are the water pressure is too high, a loose drain valve, wear and tear.

<p>Using a heating element, either electric or gas-powered, water passes into the unit and is immediately warmed to a set temperature. You will soon hear banging or rumbling sounds from your heater due to the obstruction inside the tank. New home construction is the best time to think about energy saving appliances like tankless hot water heaters, especially for gas heaters that require more home modification.</p>

The T&P valve is located on the top or the side of the water heater. For instance, if the breaker and wire size is too small to carry the electrical load of the new water heater, then a permit may be required to make the changes.</p>
<p>A tankless water heater will cost $1,950 installed.
