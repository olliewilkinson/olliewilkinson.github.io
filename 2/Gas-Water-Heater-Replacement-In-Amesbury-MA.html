<p>Free in-home estimates to replace your water heater. Before you purchase a water heater, it's also a good idea to estimate its annual operating costs and compare those costs with other less or more energy-efficient models. At a $180 yearly cost reduction, it will take 3.5 to 8 years to recover the additional expense and begin to save money. The fact that it costs significantly more to purchase and install is the only danger preventing everyone from enjoying the energy efficiency of a tankless gas water heater.</p>

There are no extra fees that some Water Heaters Only” providers tack on after removing your leaking tank.

<p>Gas water heaters are a little different from other types of water heaters, so it is important that the technician working on the heater has the right tools and experience.

Everyday tank water heaters retain large capacities of water, commonly around 50 gallons at a time.</p>
<p>But, optimizing the location relative to the plumbing fixtures in your home or business will also reduce your energy bill and water consumption. In fact, your home's gas piping, gas meter and gas line to the meter may not be sized appropriately to handle the high gas load that will be replacing the conventional storage gas water heater. The next indication that you can use to determine you need a new water heater is that there is an actual leak on the tank itself.</p>

The water is heated by using electricity, gas, or propane as the heat source, and sometimes it can reduce your electric bill by as much as 10 to 20 percent.

These gases are blown through a coil in the base of the unit, where incoming cold water can absorb most of the heat.</p>
<p>Natural-gas water heaters typically use less energy and cost less to run (by about half) than electric water heaters, although you should note that gas models cost more at the time of purchase. We also provide emergency plumbing services 24 hours a day 7 days a week. When properly maintained, tankless water heaters often have a lifespan of at least 20 years (approximately twice that of conventional storage tanks).</p>
