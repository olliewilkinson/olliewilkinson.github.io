<p>If you notice any of the symptoms above, your water heater system likely requires repair or replacement. As mentioned above, tankless water heaters are smaller than traditional tank heaters. If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>

California requires that all water heaters, including tankless, meet the state's minimum efficiency standards.</p>
<p>For residential applications, the hot water set point temperature should be only slightly above the highest temperature needed for domestic uses. A lot of times when this happens, its because the necessary repairs and maintenance were not scheduled for your water heater. Since the issue just started after you installed the tankless water heater, I would highly recommend calling the water heater company and asking them to come to take a look.</p>
<p>Water heater tanks fail because of acidic condensation build-up caused by Denver's cold water. There are three vented indoor water heaters to choose from - the R53, R85, and R93. The company doing the replacement will have to bring in the proof of warranty, either the tank itself or the label from it showing the dates in order to get the new tank. The difference is the burners apply heat to water moving through the tankless system, rather than to a standing water supply, and the burners only come on when there's a demand for water.</p>

<p>We Also Offer Tankless Water Heater Installation Service. The water is heated by using electricity, gas, or propane as the heat source, and sometimes it can reduce your electric bill by as much as 10 to 20 percent.

<p>Whole-home tankless gas water heaters have specific flow rates that are relative to the necessary temperature rise. With new water heater efficiency standards, we now have the opportunity to have it all. Although gas and electric water heaters can lose some efficiency because water is constantly being heated in the tank, current efficiency standards are much improved over the past. Most water heaters are gas, so even the smallest of mistakes made during installation can cause added expenses, property damage, injury, or even death.</p>
<p>Once the water has reached its set temperature it goes to the supply needing it via the hot water pipe at the top of the tank. Our pros can help you decide on the right water heater to fit your needs. While this type of malfunction can be irksome, repairing or replacing a thermostat is one of the least invasive repair jobs that can crop up when it comes to water heater service. Tankless: You'll need to know the flow rate of each appliance, fuel source and the rise in temperature needed.</p>
<p>Households that use more hot water, in any climate, may also find that when they ask are tankless water heaters worth it the answer is yes and no. This is because they will be using so much hot water that their heater is working just as much whether it is a tankless or a conventional. We'll answer all these questions so that you can have your hot water restored in no time. Changing from electric to gas or visa-versa could incur additional costs in venting, plumbing changes and even electrical.</p>
