<p>When you are ready for your shower you push a button and the pump sends the heated water from your water heater to your fixture more quickly than if you run the shower at full blast, and the pump shuts off when the hot water reaches it. Thus you save time, water, energy, and money. Tank heaters must always keep water warm after heating it. This process means that they continuously cycle on and off to keep water warm.</p>
