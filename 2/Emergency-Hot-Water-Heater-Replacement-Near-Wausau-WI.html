<p>Energy efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water. Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time. Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits. You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the type of traditional hot water tank you had, you may be able to install it in the same area. In addition to high upfront costs, smaller tankless units don't always deliver enough hot water to appliances and showers simultaneously. Our 24-hour emergency plumbers offer a complete range of solutions that can get a faulty system back up and running in no time. Many homeowners are interested in how tankless water heaters can save them money, since these units are more energy efficient than their tank counterparts.</p>

Tankless gas water heaters have wider applications, as they supply hot water at higher flow rates.

<p>2. You can decide to replace it when you get discolored or tainted water when you turn on the hot tap. For homes with high daily water demands, multiple tankless heaters can be installed. Also, since tank-style heaters have been around longer and are more common, more professionals are capable of installing them and the labor costs are lower. If you think you might have a shower, washing machine, and kitchen sink going at the same time, you'll need a unit that can supply 6 GPM (2.5 + 2.0 + 1.5 = 6.0 GPM).</p>
<p>Please call us for more details to see if you can get a free estimate on your new water heater. Storage tank water heaters last an average of 10-15 years, while tankless water heaters may last 20 years or more before suffering in performance due to age. While most homes will have traditional tanked units, tankless water heater systems are quickly gaining popularity, and for good reason. Compared to the 7.5 to 9.5 gallons per minute that storage tanks can pump out, tankless units average flow rates between 2.5 and 5 gallons per minute.</p>
<p>They are smaller than conventional storage heaters, are wall mounted and do not take up floor space. Common problems you can expect to experience include low gas pressure, a low heating capacity, or rusty-looking water. Make sure when you call a plumber you call a licensed plumber that is experienced in repairing tankless water heaters. Also, contact your city or town for information about obtaining a permit, if necessary, and about local water heater installation codes.</p>
<p>Compare this to a setup in a home with a small water heater where, potentially, the second or third person wanting to take a shower might have to wait for 20-30 minutes for the water heater to heat enough water. The main difference between electric and gas water heaters is the heat source. Once power and water supply issues are addressed, a tankless water heater is fairly straightforward to install and is certainly much easier to maneuver into place.</p>
<p>The requirements are designed to increase the use of low emission water heaters. The easiest way to mod your RV with a tankless water heater and get that sensational endless shower is to use an inline device that replaces the shower head. For a place that uses a lot of hot water and more then one outlet at one time then you do not want to get the standard tankless water heater. You could have an undersized heating element(s), failed element, a 240V heater wired to 120V service, etc.</p>
