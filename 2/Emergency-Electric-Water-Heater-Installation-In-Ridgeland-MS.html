<h2>Water Heater Services Ridgeland Mississippi</h2>
<p>If you had installed your storage tank water heater when fuel and electricity were abundant and cheap, then you would have realized that times have truly changed for the worse. Lee's provides a wide range of water heaters for installation, but if you're concerned with energy-efficiency, then a tankless water heater (also known as on-demand water heaters) may be just right for you. Our courteous professionals can help you determine what is right for your budget, home, and lifestyle as you look at different water heaters. Tanks of some storage water heater types are heavily insulated, which substantially reduces standby heat losses and cuts annual operating costs.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters eliminate the long wait for heat of the traditional hot water tank. 3)The amount of water that the heater allows to flow through is regulated by the desired outlet temperature. Condensing water heaters are an option if you heat with gas and need a unit with a capacity of more than 55 gallons. Planet Plumbing & Drain offers hot water heater replacement services in Boulder, Longmont and Denver metro areas.</p>
<p>When a hot water tap is turned on, water from your pipes enters the water heater and passes through the heat exchanger. It provides you with enough hot water to wash your dishes and your clothes, to bathe and shower, and to heat the water for cleaning cabinets, mopping floors, washing your hair, and more. For the home that has an average consumption of hot water a 40 gallon tank is normally sufficient. Emergency Water and Gas Shut Off Valve - Also known as "WAGS".</p>

<p>Gas tankless: Gas-fueled tankless heaters are small units that hang on the wall and require more fuel to heat water than standard gas heaters with tanks. Scale buildup can make water heater and dishwasher units less energy efficient while shortening the life of equipment and clogging your faucets and taps. Call Design Air for professional water heater installation services. First, heat rises and you are using a gas-powered unit, so if you live in a very hot climate, this could be dangerous.</p>

If only the hot water is discolored or smelly, it's because there's a high concentration of sulfates or other minerals in your tank.</p>
<p>Additional materials: some of the tankless systems will also be incompatible with the location and setup of older storage tank models.

Descale the heater and flush it according to the maintenance steps.</p>
