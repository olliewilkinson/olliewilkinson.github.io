A tankless water heater may be the right option for you.

<p>Here at Beehive Plumbing we have experience with all types of gas water heaters. Tankless units can only supply a few gallons of hot water at a time. Talk to your plumbing service technician about the cost of the required repairs to restore your water heater's function versus the cost of purchasing and installing a new system. Because the anode rod wears away over time, it's important to inspect and replace it as needed in order to maintain your water heater.</p>
<p>Water heater service is often overlooked, but your water heater is one of the most important pieces of technology in your home. If you're noticing your system is struggling to operate, hot water heater repair is needed. If you are sure you have gas, and replacing the thermocouple doesn't fix the problem, the gas control valve is about the only thing left to check. Tempering valve regulations that now require hot water tempering valves, to protect against scalding.</p>
<p>Gas-powered water heaters must vent out combustion fumes safely from the system. Unlike a storage tank water heater, which loses heat from the tank continually and must keep using energy to heat it up again, a tankless system only works when needed. After determining your fuel source, the next step is to decide if you are going to heat your water with electricity or natural gas. Your Assured Comfort plumbing experts will thoroughly examine your water heater, and explain the issue and your repair or replacement options.</p>

If the backflow which runs between the main water supply and the house is blocked, you have a closed plumbing system, and closed systems require an expansion to handle the pressure created when the water expands once it is heated.</p>

And if you need your existing system serviced or repaired, our professional, factory-trained technicians will identify the issues and make repairs. With a typical shower flow-rate of 2.5 to 3 gallons per minute (or slightly less with modern fixtures and flow restrictors), most tankless heaters will not be able to keep up with a secondary demand, for instance, from a dishwasher, clothes washer, or second shower location.</p>
