No matter your brand of water heater, or if it's gas or electric, our skilled team can handle your repair effectively and affordably. Whether it be in your commercial business or your home, water heaters are vital across the board. Tankless water heaters are a compact, efficient way to supply hot water to your home.

<p>These are not required for gas instant hot water systems. Electric water heaters are high-voltage (240-volt) appliances that are dangerous to work with when the power is on. Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box). Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>
