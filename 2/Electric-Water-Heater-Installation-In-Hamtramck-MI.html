I called several places about the water heater, and they said it would cost me over $1,000. Even though the water heater does show any signs of failure, it needs to be checked regularly to avoid any expensive repairs in the future.

A tankless water heater may be the right option for you.

<p>I need to purchase a new water heater SOON. Energy Saving: You'll notice the difference in your electricity bill since you don't have to heat up an entire tank of water. Your water heater's size is determined by how much warm water you use and what kind of heater you select. Other terms for Tankless are Combination, Combi Boilers, Continuous Flow, Inline, Flash, On-Demand or Instant-On Water heaters. Tankless water systems are popular for the simple reasons that tankless systems provide you with a virtually endless supply of hot water both where and when you need it. With old style tank systems, heated water can sit for long periods of time, generating hard-water scale and using costly energy to maintain water temperatures.</p>

<p>Noritz has been an innovator in the water heating industry for over 60 years. This way the cold water can flow back to the heater through the cold water line. Mr. Electric service professionals are trained and experienced in installing tankless water heaters. Tankless hot water heaters come in three different types : non-condensing, condensing, non-condensing hybrid. By only heating water when it's needed, tankless water heaters do not experience standby heat loss, which occurs when heat escapes the water tank and needs constant reheating.</p>
<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>

Leaks and drips, the pressure valve and even the pilot light going out are other common troubleshooting areas that hot water heaters may present, whether they're located in a commercial or residential facility.
