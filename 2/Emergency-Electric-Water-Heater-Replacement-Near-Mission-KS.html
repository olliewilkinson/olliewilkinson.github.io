Your tankless water heater only runs when you need hot water, so it is subjected to less wear and tear than a normal water tank.</p>

Instead, each efficient Rinnai tankless water heater is only the size of a small suitcase.</p>

There will be either a lever or knob on one of the water pipes coming out of the wall to the water heater. Use dielectric fittings when connecting copper pipe to steel water heater connections. As long as your unit is the right capacity for the number of people in your home, that should mean no one ever has to settle for cold or lukewarm water again.</p>
