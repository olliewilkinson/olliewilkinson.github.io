<h2>Water Heater Services Brookfield Connecticut</h2>
<p>When your hot water heater breaks, you will know that something isn't right when there is no hot water coming from your faucets. By heating water on demand, no water tank was necessary. There are things you can buy to get around this issue, but for the most part, the tankless water heater is only going to generate heat when it's needed. Storage tank: Tank style water heaters are less expensive than tankless. If you notice your water is taking too long to get hot, or you are running out of hot water very quickly, it is time to call a professional plumber for a water heater inspection.</p>
<p>Fortunately, since tankless heaters do not have a tank, there is absolutely zero risk of an explosion ever occurring. Sometimes the hot water tank in the system is the only one used to provide the home with hot water—and many modern solar water tanks come with a built-in electric element for auxiliary heating when the sun isn't shining enough. In commercial settings, manifold systems link multiple tankless units together to dramatically increase their heating capacity while decreasing the individual load.</p>
<p>Gas fittings and electrical connections age and wear out over time as well, all of which can lead to the decision to replace your current water heater. Water heaters that have not been properly installed and inspected can become a fire, explosion and health hazard for your building and occupants. Once we find the issue with your water heater we will be able to repair it then and there. This is because instead of wasting energy keep water warm in a tank, a tankless water heater only heats water as you use it.</p>
