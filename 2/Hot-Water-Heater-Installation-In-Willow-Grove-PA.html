<h2>Water Heater Services Willow Grove Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Do your homework and you'll see that the energy efficiency factor makes finding the best tankless hot water heater worth the effort. This company makes some of the best tankless water heaters on the market. Added Property Value: Whether you're planning on selling, or looking for high-end renters for your property, a tankless water heater is a great selling point for your property. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater.</p>
<p>Typically a 30-40 gallon heater is appropriate for a family of up to four, and a 50-80 gallon tank is appropriate if there are five or more people in the household. Pilot light on gas water heater flickers out. These particular Water Heaters are rapidly gaining in popularity and will soon become the standard. Our New Jersey plumbers can provide you with an honest assessment of your water heater to determine if the unit can still be repaired or if it's time for a replacement.</p>
<p>That's because homes here are usually equipped for a standard, storage tank water heater. You are not afraid of running out of hot water again since they instantly heat water instead of warming a large bath tub or pool perhaps. One solution to the long wait is to install a small tank water heater after the tankless water heater to act as a tempering tank, but once you do that, it's no longer a truly tankless system.</p>
<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Replacement Willow Grove</h3>
<p>This may be an old resistive type heater and should be replaced by more modern heaters that can be up to 5 times more efficient at heating water. Savings: Unlike traditional water heaters, tankless units only heat water as it is needed, which results in extra energy savings per month. Although gas tankless water heaters are clearly more efficient than their storage tank cousins, their efficiency normally tops out at 80-85%.</p>
<p>Ensure to flush the water heater tank once every year. But if you're building a new home or adding to an existing one, installing a tankless water heater may make economic sense. If one of them isn't working, you'll still get hot water but it won't be as much as you're used to. Leaving the issue unresolved will ultimately result in the second heating element not working as well. And when soldering or welding, remember to flush the pipes before connecting them to the water heater and that excess heat can cause damage to the unit.</p>
<p>They are called tankless as they heat up water only during the times you turn on your hot water tap. If your water heater is nearing the end of its useful life and you're thinking of replacing it before disaster strikes, you'll be happy to know that you have better choices, thanks to recent federal regulations that require water heaters to be more energy-efficient. Since tankless models heat water on demand, they usually end up heating a lower volume of water for less time when compared to conventional water heaters.</p>
<p>The cost of hot water can be a determining factor when considering water heater repair versus water heater replacement. Very Efficient: Traditional water heaters use so much energy because they're constantly working to heat water - even when you're not home. Water heating is the second biggest energy expense in your home. Reinstall the valve in the tank using an adjustable wrench. Natural gas water heaters typically use less energy and cost less to operate than electric water heaters, but can be more expensive and difficult to install.</p>

<p>The water heater is a fairly simple appliance. When the distance between heater and fixture exceeds 50 feet, look for units with a built-in recirculation pump, which saves water and reduces waiting time. If your water heater is leaking contact us and we can assist you in shutting off the leaking water heater to help minimize any possible water damage. Tankless water heaters, on the other hand, do not store water.</p>

It is so compact it fits right under the vanity and will supply endless hot water to both sinks.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Willow Grove Pennsylvania 19090</h3>
<p>To avoid flooding from tank failure, Bill Smith Plumbing & Heating offers alarm and cold water shut-off valve options. Our experienced technicians are equipped and trained for electric water heater repair. When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution. Traditional water heaters work by heating and storing a set amount of water in a tank. Turning on hot water throughout the home activates the heater, even if the pilot light is not on, so you are able to check the pipes for leaks much more easily.</p>
<p>After many decades of service, we have found Bradford-White and Navien water heaters are the best in the industry. Consult with your local Roto-Rooter plumber to establish a water heater maintenance schedule that will maximize the life of your appliance. The T&P valve is located on the top or the side of the water heater. For instance, if the breaker and wire size is too small to carry the electrical load of the new water heater, then a permit may be required to make the changes.</p>
<p>If your water system has a check valve or anti-siphon valve on the supply line, an expansion tank near the cold intake to the heater will likely be necessary. Most smaller units are installed near the point of usage, usually on the wall. Overall, the tankless gas water heaters are not as dangerous to life as the comparable standard tank-type units, although nothing is ever 100% assured. Don't think that your heater will continue to function perfectly for many decades, regardless of how modern and expensive yours is. Hot water heater can go for many years without needing repair, but they always eventually malfunction and need fixing or replacing.</p>
<p>Also known as instant heaters, they do not produce the standby energy losses you are likely to find with traditional heaters, thereby saving you money. To make sure your water heater is restored properly, schedule an appointment with our plumbing experts. In some cases, however, the water heater may need to be replaced. A high-temperature limit switch down by the viewing door at the bottom of the tank should protect the water heater from overheating.</p>
