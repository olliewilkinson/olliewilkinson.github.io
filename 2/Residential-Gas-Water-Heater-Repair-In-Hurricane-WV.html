Our water heater repair and replacement specialists have the tools, skills, and experience needed to help with any water heater or plumbing related need.

<p>Your hot water heater controls the water temperature of your home or business.

They save energy (and save you money), they provide unlimited hot water, they're small and compact, they never leak and don't contribute to harmful metals in your water.</p>
<p>Tankless heaters can last up to 20 years but need to be maintained at least once a year. Once the water turns off, so does the tankless unit, saving energy and reducing wear and tear.

Maintaining your equipment might seem unnecessary at times but will improve the life of your water heater as well as save you from having to replace it as often. Like most common appliances, this particular plumbing fixture runs on electricity to effectively heat up water.</p>
<p>When the demand for water ceases, the unit shuts down and uses no energy, a revolutionary advantage over a standard water heater. Deciding which water heater offers the best value comes down to a number of factors, such as fuel source, efficiency, water usage, and size. A 100-gallon storage tank is going to take up a lot of room, and buying a water heater that is too large can cause all sorts of problems. The benefit of tankless water heaters in that scenario is that your whole family can take showers back-to-back without worrying about running out of hot water.</p>
<p>A. Smith's point-of-use electric tankless water heaters provide on-demand hot water for single use and specialized applications.
