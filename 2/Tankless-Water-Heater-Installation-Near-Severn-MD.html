<h2>Water Heater Services Severn Maryland</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call. A tank-style water heater expends energy around the clock to maintain the temperature of a 40 to 50-gallon water supply so that hot water is ready when it's needed. Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>

Because of the demands of larger households, it might make sense to install one or more additional tankless units. The computer pulls in gas and ignites a fire within the contained burner, which provides heat to the heat exchanger The incoming water is then circulated through the activated heat exchanger, heating the water to the temperature set on the thermostat before leaving the system through the hot water outlet pipe where it is directed to the appropriate faucet or appliance.</p>

Over time, the heating element may wear out.
