<p>Tankless water heaters are also the most eco-friendly, since they only heat water when it is needed. The cost of a new water heater depends largely on the type and size of the heater. You should always buy a new tankless water heater system to prevent issues and concerns from coming up. Tankless water heaters may be that solution. Professional installation of your tankless system is absolutely essential. Befor you replace your current water heater, learn four common myths associated with tankless units.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, provide hot water only as it is needed. A tankless heater has a flow sensing device that is activated whenever a hot water tap is opened. A tankless heater only uses energy while it's heating water. Then, the temperature of your water will slowly decrease until the hot water in the tank has been completely replaced with "cold" water. These water heaters come up 98% efficient and once running will provide you with an endless stream of hot water.</p>
<p>Gas water heater: Connect the gas line to the gas burner control valve. A conventional gas water heater is a tried-and-tested system designed to keep your home's hot water running. You can control the output temperature directly on the tankless water heater, so you know how hot the water is delivered to your taps will be. Tankless heaters have become popular due to their many benefits. They both use an insulated storage tank jacket made of steel, with insulation between the storage tank and the tank jacket to reduce heat loss of the heated water.</p>
<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
