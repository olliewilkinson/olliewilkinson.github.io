<p>While tankless water heaters cost more upfront, they help you save so much water that the costs you save from your reduced water bill can actually pay off your unit in just a few years. This may force someone down the cost-saving route before they've fully considered the benefits of a tankless system. Since in many instances you purge the cooled off hot water from the hot lines before you use the hot fixture, you want the hot piping from the heater to the fixtures to be as short as possible.</p>

If your water heater is nearing the end of its useful life and you're thinking of replacing it before disaster strikes, you'll be happy to know that you have better choices, thanks to recent federal regulations that require water heaters to be more energy-efficient.
