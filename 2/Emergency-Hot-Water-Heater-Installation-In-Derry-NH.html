<p>One modern day luxury that we often take for granted is the ability to have a hot bath or shower at the flick of a water faucet. But if you use hot water only in the morning and in the evening, like most full time working people do, your energy bill will go down substantially. It is very common for water heaters to have sediment buildups, either if the water has a high amount of minerals or the heater get older. It allows for significant energy savings and an endless supply of hot water. With a tankless hot water heater installation, you will no longer have to heat water all day and night.</p>
<p>1. Tankless water heaters require regular ongoing maintenance in order to run at their best efficiency. This requires a great deal of energy and puts incredible strain on the unit, which is why storage water heaters wear out after only eight to 12 years. In addition, SETS tankless water heaters are the only systems that offer a 100% lifetime parts replacement warranty. The downside is that, if you have multiple showers running at the same time, tankless water heaters are not able to keep up. This isn't just a problem with showers, depending on the size of your water heater, you can run into issues by having a shower and the dishwasher running at the same time.</p>
