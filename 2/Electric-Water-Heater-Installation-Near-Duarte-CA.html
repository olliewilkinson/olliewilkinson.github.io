<h2>Water Heater Services Duarte California</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Replacing a water heater usually costs $500 to $1,800 for a replacement of the same style and size. Another feature for the tankless water heater is a unit with an increased flow rate. The greater the desired Temperature Rise, the less Gallons per Minute of hot water can be produced. Our team of professionals is highly trained, knowledgeable, and experienced in all water heater installations and repairs. Such installation may result in an explosion or fire, but sometimes there may be no other choices.</p>
<p>Gas-fired tank-type water heaters use a burner centered underneath the tank to heat the hot water storage tank, which in turn heats the water within the tank. You are left with a smile and a new warranty on your professionally installed water heater. Electric tankless water heaters still save homeowners around $44 per year according to the US Department of Energy. Another reason for sticking with the more popular tankless water heater manufacturers is for the reasons of maintenance.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Duarte California 91010</h3>
<p>Follow along with the steps in this article and you will have your new water heater installed in a couple of hours. If you're still not getting hot water from your tankless unit, it's time to call a professional. If there is no hot water in the device, the heating element is probably not working. Here we tell you how to install a heater core and also how to remove and replace it. And we tell you about some common heater core problems, and how to tackle them.</p>
<p>With a standard unit you have to keep reheating the water over and over again, day after day, and year after year but a tankless hot water heater gives you an endless supply and uses about 50% less electricity. In regards to the cost of operation, natural gas and propane water heaters are less expensive to operate than electric or oil units of the same size. Traditional water heaters have hot water sitting at the top of the tank ready to go. On a tankless unit, cold water enters the heat exchanger tubing and begins to be heated.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: Yes, most tankless water heater repairs require a professional. A great way to start changing the house from being less dependent on traditional energy sources and electricity companies to install solar hot water panels. The basic gas heater installation requires the properly sized tankless water heater, venting components, extension of the hot and cold piping, an electrical connection and a gas connection.</p>
<p>If your tank is leaking or the water is no longer running clear, these are cases where you absolutely have to replace your heater altogether. Copy the nameplate data of the water heater to purchase correct replacement parts. As water heaters generally hold 50 gallons of water, a breakdown can result in a damaging flood. If repair is not an option, we will help you determine the best replacement. One set of coils is the water line, the other, the heating element.</p>
<p>The most common types of traditional and tankless water heaters seen in residential settings are either electric or gas-powered products. The first step of installing a new water heater is to detach the existing one. Residential and commercial property owners who are wanting to update their water heaters typically go with tank water heaters. Whether you are building a new home or you are looking to install a more efficient water heater for your residential or commercial project, choosing the right system is important.</p>
