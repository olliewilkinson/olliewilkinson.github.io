At the same time, we want you to be aware of unexpected installation aspects you could face if you choose a tankless heater so you're not caught off guard.</p>
<p>Often, one main Tankless Water Heater will be installed near the furnace, and supplemental smaller Tankless ones will be situated in tactical spots, such as a far reaching bathrooms, etc to be located right where the water is being used. Tankless water heaters need to be flushed once a year to maintain the manufacturer's warranty. If you're already in your forever home” or plan to stay where you are for a while, investing in a tankless water heater will save you from needing a replacement for a very long time.</p>
<p>Heaters with water tank normally consume lots of extra energy to keep the stored water warm, which in turn, cost higher for the operation. Your old water heater was probably D rated, whereas these new units are A rated and better for the environment. This is the kind of energy-saving customization that is impossible with tank-style water heaters. That may be enough to supply a whole house in areas with warm groundwater, but in colder climes they're better suited to point-of-use service, where the demand for hot water doesn't get too high.</p>
