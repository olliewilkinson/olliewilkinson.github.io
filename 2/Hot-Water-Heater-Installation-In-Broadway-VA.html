<h2>Water Heater Services Broadway Virginia</h2>
<p>As you may know, there are three varieties of water heaters: tank less or instant, solar and the tank or the storage. I called several places about the water heater, and they said it would cost me over $1,000. Even though the water heater does show any signs of failure, it needs to be checked regularly to avoid any expensive repairs in the future. Mallick Plumbing & Heating is the Service Contractor of Choice in Silver Spring, MD and throughout Montgomery County. Storage tank water heaters have lower initial cost by a significant margin.</p>
<p>Here at Althoff, we have professional plumbers that can install any size water heater for residential and commercial buildings, and they have the knowledge, experience and skill to pull the required permits and properly install the water heater. If you are finding that your water is not getting hot enough or that it is running out quickly, it could be time for a new heating element for your water heater.</p>

Because they use up to 30 to 50 percent less energy, tankless units can save an average family about $100 or more annually, depending on water usage. Regular maintenance is required for a longer life of a water heater.</p>
<p>However, if you're considering an electric tankless water heater, you'll need to make sure your home's electric panel can handle the added load.
