<p>Typically, you'll have a choice between gas, electric, tankless, and even solar-powered water heaters. Since the tank is the only part of the system that can actually force you to replace the water heater, be sure to troubleshoot before you buy a new unit. There is also a range of fuel sources that can heat water such as solar, gas, electricity and wood. Also known as instantaneous water heater, the heater heats the water on demand.</p>
<p>Often, one main Tankless Water Heater will be installed near the furnace, and supplemental smaller Tankless ones will be situated in tactical spots, such as a far reaching bathrooms, etc to be located right where the water is being used.

They constantly heat water so hot water is regularly prepared. If a tank still makes noise once sediment has been flushed, there is probably a more serious problem with the water heater overall.</p>
<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions.
