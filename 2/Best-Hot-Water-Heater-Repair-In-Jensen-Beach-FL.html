<h2>Water Heater Services Jensen Beach Florida</h2>
<p>Paloma tankless hot water heaters are among the popular choices out there. On the other hand, tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, do not rely on preheated water. Turn off the power to the water heater in the service panel. From our experience in both commercial water heater repair and those of private homes, we have identified various reasons leading to regular repairs and fixed them for our clients. By installing a unit that's similar to a standard tank water heater, you can experience hot water right when you need it for as long as you need it.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>

<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement Jensen Beach</h3>
<p>If your water comes out smelling like rotten eggs, there could be bacteria in the hot water heater tank. In our Chicago climate we experience extremely cold weather that can occasionally cause a main water line or incorrectly installed tankless water heater to freeze and prevent water from flowing. However, tankless water heaters are more energy efficient because you're only heating water as you need it. A water heater with a tank needs energy to heat up to 100 gallons, for example, and then needs energy to keep it hot all day long or until it's used.</p>
<p>Water underneath the water heater is almost always a sure sign that your water heater needs replacing. Raise the gas burner or the lower heating element on an electric water heater at least eighteen inches above the floor if the equipment is in the garage. In large homes however, you might need more than one for a proper supply of hot water. Generally residential water heaters have a life expectancy of 8-12 years.</p>
<p>Check the main switch on the water heater and the circuit breaker (or fuse) that serves the water heater. A tankless water heater is more expensive than its traditional counterpart. The only problem I found with it, which I later discovered that it is common to all brands of this water heaters is that the installation can be expensive, since you may need upgrades to pipes and additional electrical work. In addition, water in a tank has to be heated hotter than necessary to account for these stand-by losses.</p>
