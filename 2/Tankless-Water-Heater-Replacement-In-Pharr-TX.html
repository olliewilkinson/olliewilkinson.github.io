You're planning on moving in the near future and you won't be able to recover the longterm savings a tankless water heater provides.

Electric tankless water heaters provide continuous hot water when sized appropriately, producing and maintaining hot water throughout your home or business as needed.

<p>Tankless water heaters are energy efficient compared to traditional water heating systems, as they do not work until a hot water faucet is turned on. Regular maintenance can keep your tankless unit going up to 20 years — twice as long as standard storage water heaters. That's because of their reputation for running more efficiently, an appealing characteristic given that heating water is the average U.S. home's second highest utility cost after heating and cooling the house itself.</p>

<p>To keep your tankless water heater running like new, you can do a few things yourself - like cleaning the air and in-line water filters - but an annual maintenance service visit is highly recommended. Depending on where you live, there may be one or more thermostats to deliver the best comfort; one to control the tubing water supply temperature, one to control different zones throughout the home, and one for outside the home.</p>
<p>On a gas unit, also shut off the gas and unplug the electrical supply or turn off the circuit breaker. This happens because several feet of pipes separate the faucet from the water heater, and the water cools as it sits unused in the pipes.

Typically, tankless water heaters, which heat water only when you need it, cost more but can save about 25 percent of annual water heating costs, on average.</p>

<p>Problems such as rusty or discolored water, strange noises or low or no heat are also indicators it's time to get your water heater repaired or replaced. A tankless water heater is also called an "on-demand" water heater, because it only heats water when you turn on the hot water tap.

When it comes down to powering the heating process, tankless water heaters use 30-50% less electricity than water storage tank models. When you need hot water, the tankless water heater draws cold water into the heater, circulates it around a heat exchanger, and sends it back out into your home's piping.</p>

<p>Our dedicated, expert technicians have extensive training and years of experience in the installation of new, high performing and energy-saving water heaters. Installing heating systems in your home can help you maintain a constant temperature. A tankless water heater only heats water when it's needed, which means lower water heating costs and no more having to worry about running out of hot water.
