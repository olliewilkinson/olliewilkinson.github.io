It also means that you should never run out” of hot water, because it is continually heated for as long as you leave hot water running.

<p>Tankless water heaters have been growing in popularity lately, especially with the new water heater energy efficiency regulations.

Tankless water heaters can also be used as a booster for dishwashers, washing machines, and as a backup for solar or wood-fired domestic systems. However, once they run out of water, users must wait for a new tank to reheat. If you're worried about installation costs, then you might want to consider electric tankless water heaters.</p>
<p>The basic premise behind a tankless heater is that the water is not forced to stay within a tank, being heated and reheated until it's used.

If a gas water heater is incorrectly vented, hot gases can present a fire danger inside the walls. Until, of course, the water heater suddenly stops working, and all that hot water that once flowed freely is nothing but a near-freezing stream — not something you're thrilled to take a shower in.</p>
