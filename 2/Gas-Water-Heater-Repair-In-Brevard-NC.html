To overcome this problem, you can install a whole house”-type tankless water heater or install two or more tankless water heaters, connected in parallel for simultaneous demands of hot water. There is a heating mechanism at the bottom that heats the water which then rises to the top of the tank. Hot water tanks are rated for their Energy Factor” (EF) which measures how much hot water is produced per unit of fuel.</p>

<h3>Professional Experience Is Essential For A Good Plumber Brevard NC</h3>
<p>Many homeowners, however, see benefits of a tankless water heater beyond energy savings. If you are looking for a 55+ gallon electric tank water heater, you will have to purchase a hybrid or heat pump, or a condensate tank if your fuel type is natural gas. Tankless water heaters work in almost any environment when mounted inside or outside your home or business. A water heater expansion tank costs $40 to $200 with labor adding another $50 to $150.</p>
<p>For residential applications, the hot water set point temperature should be only slightly above the highest temperature needed for domestic uses. A lot of times when this happens, its because the necessary repairs and maintenance were not scheduled for your water heater. Since the issue just started after you installed the tankless water heater, I would highly recommend calling the water heater company and asking them to come to take a look.</p>

That's why water heater manufacturers install a sacrificial anode rod in the tank.</p>
