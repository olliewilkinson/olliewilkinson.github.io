<p>Like their name implies, these compact units heat your water without the use of a cumbersome tank that takes up space in your utility room or basement. Although uncommon, issues can arise if something isn't working correctly within your water heater. Iinstead of waiting until your heater breaks, you should plan (now, while the water is hot!) for your water heater's replacement. Sometimes, however, even the largest, gas-fired model cannot supply enough hot water for simultaneous, multiple uses in large households.</p>
<p>Please call us for more details to see if you can get a free estimate on your new water heater. Storage tank water heaters last an average of 10-15 years, while tankless water heaters may last 20 years or more before suffering in performance due to age. While most homes will have traditional tanked units, tankless water heater systems are quickly gaining popularity, and for good reason. Compared to the 7.5 to 9.5 gallons per minute that storage tanks can pump out, tankless units average flow rates between 2.5 and 5 gallons per minute.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that a tankless water heater isn't a good product to utilize. As people and companies all across the country take additional preparations to protect against the Coronavirus (COVID-19), we acknowledge that your Plumbing, Heating and cooling problems will likely not be taking a break. This suitcase-size unit heats water as it flows through a coil of pipes and makes hot water only as you use it.</p>

<p>A tankless water heater does not heat and re-heat the same water in the tank, saving you money. Noise - water heaters collect mineral deposits and sediment on the heating elements, just at the bottom of the tank. Enjoy having steady hot water again and call Trusted Plumbing. Thus the best option would be to invite a qualified plumbing and heating contractor to install your water heater like the one from Downey Plumbing Heating & Air Conditioning.</p>
