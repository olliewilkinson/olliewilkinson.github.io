<p>Your water heater is one of the single most expensive components of your plumbing system. Typically, Houston water heater tanks are made of steel and lined with glass to prevent the steel from rusting. We will show you the potential causes and after you enter your model number into the search field, we'll sell you the exact part that fits your water heater and show you how to install it. Light the pilot light in the new water heater and adjust the temperature setting. The water that flows through the pipes isn't halted at any point to be heated so you may have to set the thermostat a bit higher to get the temperature of water you want for your shower, bath or dishwasher.</p>

Sometimes the hot water tank in the system is the only one used to provide the home with hot water—and many modern solar water tanks come with a built-in electric element for auxiliary heating when the sun isn't shining enough. In commercial settings, manifold systems link multiple tankless units together to dramatically increase their heating capacity while decreasing the individual load.</p>

A tankless water heater is less likely to corrode than a storage tank system, but if the pipes start to leak, corrosion can start up. If the corrosion develops too far, the whole system may need to be replaced.</p>
<p>As opposed to the more traditional way of heating water with a water tank, the wait is far less for the water to heat up and stays hotter for longer while using less energy. A family that needs frequently needs a large volume hot water (running the shower, dishwasher, and washing machine at the same time, for example), may find that a tankless water heater can't supply enough hot water to meet their needs.</p>
