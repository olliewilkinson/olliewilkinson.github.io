<h3>Water Tank Repair Von Ormy Texas 78073</h3>
<p>Water heater usage costs $150 to $700 per year. WATER HARDNESS: Scale deposits that form in a heat exchanger (or on electric heating elements) slow down heat transfer and constrict water flow. The plumbing runs from the heat exchanger in the hot water tank, to the expansion tank, up through the solar collectors above, down through the pressure relief system, and then finally back to the heat exchanger in the tank.</p>
<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>
<p>If you ever see boiling water coming out of your faucet, or can see steam, you need to turn off your heater immediately and get a professional to inspect it. Boiling water usually means that the thermostat is broken and is overheating. We eliminate the stress and fear of replacing your water heater, by making the repair a fast, friendly, and comfortable experience. This means that the cause is somewhere between the water heater and the fixtures.</p>
<p>The most popular brands of water heaters are reliable, affordable, have good value and are always available. While tankless water heaters run more efficiently than storage tank water heaters, replacing a tank water heater with a tankless can be expensive, and the payback time can be longer than the warranty. An undersized water heater may also be the problem if too much water is being used to heat it adequately.</p>
<p>Use channel-type pliers or a pipe wrench to loosen and disconnect the lines from the water heater. Over time, water heaters often suffer from sediment build-up that can damage the tank. For example, a sudden loss of hot water may mean that the pilot has gone out. Be sure to connect the cold water pipe to the cold water inlet on the water heater. Cold water enters the tank and is heated by an electric element or gas burner.</p>
