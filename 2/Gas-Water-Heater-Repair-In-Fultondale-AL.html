<p>Installing a tankless hot water heater can be pricy. Fortunately, it can be easily remedied with a simple call to the experts at Valley Air Heating, Cooling & Plumbing. Identical water heaters don't always perform as well. In colder climates like ours with colder groundwater, smaller tankless water heaters will only deliver enough hot water for one shower at a time. Moreover, much of the heat produced by the pilot light of a tank-type model heats the water in the tank, heat that is just lost with the instantaneous units.</p>
<p>While conventional tanks can last for 10 to 12 years, tankless water heaters typically last for 20 years or more. Most tank heaters are expected to last 8-10 years. In Singapore, there are many plumbing services companies that offer water heater installation and repair services, however, their expertise may vary. Once our plumbers determine the fuel source in your home, they can start narrowing down the water heater selection.</p>
<p>If the hot water system installation needs additional fittings or if the plumbing or electrical installation requires upgrading, the hot water system installation cost rises. Chances are the clue that tipped you off to your water heater problem was a lack of hot water. With an electric heater, you will need to flip the breaker switch to "off". Also a couple of easy do-it-yourself projects such as insulating hot water pipes and regulating your water heating temperature, can also contribute to saving both money and energy on your water heating.</p>
