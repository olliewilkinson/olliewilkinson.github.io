<h2>Water Heater Services Dickson Tennessee</h2>
<p>Paloma tankless hot water heaters are among the popular choices out there. On the other hand, tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, do not rely on preheated water. Turn off the power to the water heater in the service panel. From our experience in both commercial water heater repair and those of private homes, we have identified various reasons leading to regular repairs and fixed them for our clients. By installing a unit that's similar to a standard tank water heater, you can experience hot water right when you need it for as long as you need it.</p>
<p>1. Tankless water heaters require regular ongoing maintenance in order to run at their best efficiency. This requires a great deal of energy and puts incredible strain on the unit, which is why storage water heaters wear out after only eight to 12 years. In addition, SETS tankless water heaters are the only systems that offer a 100% lifetime parts replacement warranty. The downside is that, if you have multiple showers running at the same time, tankless water heaters are not able to keep up. This isn't just a problem with showers, depending on the size of your water heater, you can run into issues by having a shower and the dishwasher running at the same time.</p>
<p>This problem is only compounded as sediment build up in the tank over time and reduces the amount of hot water the tank can store. In the case of installing electric tankless water heaters you may be required to have an electrician upgrade the electrical service to your home or plug, depending on its age and set up. We have a wide variety of gas and electric tank water heaters available in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>

A tank-less water heater has lower operating costs, uses less space and can reduce energy consumption by as much as 30%.</p>
