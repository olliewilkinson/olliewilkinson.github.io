<h2>Water Heater Services Germantown Maryland</h2>
<p>At Gary's Plumbing and Heating, we service all your water heating problems.

Tankless systems cost twice as much as traditional tank units, however because they only heat water only at the time it is being used, they are far more energy-efficient.</p>
<p>Keep a reservoir of hot water available at all times so that when you turn on the tap, it's ready to use. The water passes through a heat exchanger, where heat from either natural gas or electrical heating elements is applied to it. The heat exchanger is activated by the movement of water, so the water is only heated when a tap turns on demanding hot water somewhere in the house. Leak repair: If you notice water anywhere near the unit, call a plumber right away.</p>
