Discuss the two types of water heaters with your plumber to weigh your options.

Homeowners with on-demand water heaters typically use 50 gallons or less of hot water each day.</p>
<p>Your hot water is rust-colored: This is likely a sign that the inside of your tank is rusting, which means it's aging and breaking down. Another option, one that Petersen Plumbing is seeing more and more often in the market today, is the tankless water heater, sometimes called an on-demand water heater. From standard tank water heaters to tankless to solar water heaters, we offer a solution that will fit your needs and save energy.</p>
