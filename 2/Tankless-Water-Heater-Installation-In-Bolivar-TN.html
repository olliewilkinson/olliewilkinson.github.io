<h2>Water Heater Services Bolivar Tennessee</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Cleaner water - A tankless unit provides cleaner water too. Energy conservation is a great feature of on-demand tankless water heaters, but it's not the only great feature. Whether you're showering, washing clothing, doing dishes, or just brewing coffee, it's important to have access to hot water when you want it. We care about your home's plumbing system and want to make sure your water heater is running properly.</p>
<p>Heat pump water heaters qualify as tank-type water heaters and are powered by electricity. You turn on the shower and feel warm water at first, but then get blasted with several seconds of cold water before the temperature slowly climbs back up. Here's what happened: When the first shower ended, some hot water was remaining in the pipes on the way to the shower. Call your local water heating experts at B&B Heating & Cooling.</p>
