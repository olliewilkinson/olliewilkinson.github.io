<p>Whether you need a new water heater installation or some help with maintenance, you can trust our plumbing experts to help keep your home and family comfortable. Besides energy and cost savings, there are several other reasons to choose a tankless water heater over a traditional tank-style heater. Tankless units are complicated. Gas hot water not working is unusual, as gas hot water systems tend to be very reliable.</p>
<p>This means hooking up water lines and, for gas units, tying in the gas line and a ventilation system to remove exhaust fumes produced by burning gas for heating. Depending on the number of people in your home and your daily hot water needs, a water heater that once provided sufficient hot water may have trouble keeping up with your current demands, especially if they have changed. Enjoy your new water heater and the satisfaction you have in doing it yourself.</p>
<p>In your specific case, this may require a larger gas line or a much larger electric supply than what is currently running to your water heater location. Only gas can produce enough hot water for a large home. Contact us anytime you think your water heater needs repair service. If you're not getting hot water, it could be the heating element or another maintenance issue. Whether you have a gas, propane, or electric water heater, there might be times when you wish you had more hot water to work with.</p>
<p>Also known as instant heaters, they do not produce the standby energy losses you are likely to find with traditional heaters, thereby saving you money. To make sure your water heater is restored properly, schedule an appointment with our plumbing experts. In some cases, however, the water heater may need to be replaced. A high-temperature limit switch down by the viewing door at the bottom of the tank should protect the water heater from overheating.</p>
<p>Fuel type (electric vs. gas)- Gas tankless water heaters are usually more expensive to install than electric water heaters, but cost less to operate on a monthly basis. Another major reason for people electing a tankless system is avoidance of the "shower frigid dance." If you have ever been halfway through a shower and had the hot water give out, you know what I mean. Considering the many advantages over traditional tank-type units, it isn't hard to see why homeowners love tankless systems.</p>
