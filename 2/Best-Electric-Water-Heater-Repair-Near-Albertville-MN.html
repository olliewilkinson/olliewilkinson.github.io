<h2>Water Heater Services Albertville Minnesota</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Call (855) 982-2028 to schedule service with our water heater experts. Additionally, the water cools and is re-heated in the tank several times each day while no one is home. As with almost anything you buy, tankless water heaters run the gamut in price from under $500 to over $3,000. Water heaters have a shelf life and eventually, they'll bite the dust. Direct vent heaters are the recommended types of heaters to install.</p>

<p>A Leaky Tank: If you notice that your water heater is leaking, you could be experiencing loose pipes or a failed valve. The idea is to embark on a proactive search for the plumbing services before your water heater breaks down. But as time passes by and your water heater is slowly decaying, you can expect its relief valve to lose its function. Because tankless water heaters don't store heated water, they use less energy and save you money on your utility bills.</p>

<p>Like all other plumbing systems in your home, regular maintenance can ensure your home's hot water heater continues to perform at its very best. Whenever removing electric elements on an electric water heater, be sure that the electricity is turned off. Tankless units last about 5-10 years longer than conventional units. Even if you are replacing your water heater with a conventional one, the installation process is not as simple as it might seem.</p>
<p>Age: If your unit is older, and especially if it requires repairs or replacement parts to keep it functioning, it can be more cost-effective to install a new unit. Frequent breakdowns are a good indicator that it may be time for a full water heater replacement. Tank-style heaters don't produce hot water instantly either but since they have a supply ready to go and don't need to kick on, it reaches the outlet more quickly.</p>
