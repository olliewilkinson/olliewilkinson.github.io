With all this in mind, it's generally better to let an expert install your tankless water heater. If you start to hear rumbling from your water heater, keep an eye out for any small leaks.

Run clean water through the heater for a few minutes, using the same pump arrangement as before.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained.
