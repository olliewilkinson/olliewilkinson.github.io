<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>All these are the drawbacks for the traditional water heater tanks. Tankless gas water heaters eliminate storage losses and work more efficiently than tankless electric water heaters. If you're interested in having a hot water tank installed in your home contact Novel Care today.

Wait a little while, then check the water temperature at a faucet.</p>
