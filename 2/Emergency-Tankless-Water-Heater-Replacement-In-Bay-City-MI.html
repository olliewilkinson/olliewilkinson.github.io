<h2>Water Heater Services Bay City Michigan</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>Highly efficient water heaters such as tankless coil and indirect ones use less energy than conventional units, saving homeowners money on their utility bills in the long run. Hot water can add up to 25% of your energy bill, so be sure to choose an energy efficient heating appliance. These signs could mean that it's time to look into water heater repair. While a tankless water heater can provide an unlimited amount of hot water, it can only provide a limited volume.</p>
<p>Water heater type: Whole-home tankless units provide hot water to all plumbing fixtures in your home, while point-of-use (POU) units only provide hot water for a single appliance or area (like the kitchen or laundry room). The tankless heater is much smaller than a traditional tank water heater. Longer useful lives than storage tank water heaters. Many homeowners in Fort Wayne, IN are switching to a tankless water heater.</p>

Electric water heaters tend to be more energy-efficient than gas water heaters, but the cost of electricity can make the electric the more expensive choice. Whereas with a tankless hot water heater all you have to do is turn off the water supply to that location disconnect the supply lines and you are basically finished.</p>
<p>A tankless water heater uses a heat source (electric or gas) to warm up cool water on-demand whenever you need it rather than storing hot water in a tank. A water heater expansion tank is a must if your home runs on a closed water supply system. Water heater repair is what is required, hence get in touch with a plumber. After paying another plumbing company $70.00 to give me a crazy estimate of $2,500 to replace my water heater, I began calling other plumbers asking for a free estimate.</p>

Also, you will save money because the tankless water heater doesn't have a tank. However, the type of water heater you need for your home will greatly depend on what fuel type you already have.</p>

<p>A small electric spark that ignites the gas usually starts the units, little cause for alarm. But it is important to note right up front that the cost of converting your current system to tankless or "demand" is more costly then substituting a conventional tank. If you want to save money, invest in professional water heater installation. Keeping your water heater in good working order is always the best first step.</p>
<p>For instance, for a home with two stories and a basement, the worst place to install the heater is in the basement. However if you find that you have no hot water with an electric tank it would be a good idea to check your breaker to see if the breaker has tripped. A broken or deteriorated dip tube can cause the cold water to stay near the top, making your water heater unable to heat the water properly. There are a lot of reasons why a homeowner or business owner might choose to upgrade to a new water heater, with some of them ranging from the size to the water heater's ability to heat up water.</p>

Our experts at Anthony Plumbing, the premier Plumber in Kansas City recommend replacing the heater before it starts displaying performance issues to save on heating costs. There will need to be two or three people to perform this stage, due to the size of the water heater and the height at which it will be mounted.</p>
<p>Gas units are available in a large variety of models and sizes for both home and commercial use and range in output from 130,000 to 380,000 BTUs. Another very common water heater repair issue is no hot water. First, check the water heater's circuit breaker in the service panel to make sure it hasn't tripped.
