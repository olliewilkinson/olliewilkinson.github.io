<h2>Water Heater Services Chappaqua New York</h2>

Tankless water heaters Wall-mounted tankless units heat water on demand, only heating as much as is required for your needs.

Also a couple of easy do-it-yourself projects such as insulating hot water pipes and regulating your water heating temperature, can also contribute to saving both money and energy on your water heating.</p>
<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
