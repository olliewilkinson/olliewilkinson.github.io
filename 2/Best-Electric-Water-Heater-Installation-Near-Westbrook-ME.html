<h2>Water Heater Services Westbrook Maine</h2>

A tankless water heater may be the right option for you. Currently, there is too little data to accurately estimate life expectancy for tankless water heaters, but preliminary data shows that tankless water heaters could last up to 20 years.</p>
<p>Gas-fired tank-type water heaters use a burner centered underneath the tank to heat the hot water storage tank, which in turn heats the water within the tank. You are left with a smile and a new warranty on your professionally installed water heater. Electric tankless water heaters still save homeowners around $44 per year according to the US Department of Energy.

Homeowners believing they now had cheap hot water tended to use a lot more water than before the solar heaters were installed.</p>

You have a tight budget and installing a tankless water heater doesn't fall within that budget or doesn't work with your financing options. Storage water heater: Life expectancy of 10-15 years and produces standby heat loss. When water heaters spring a leak, repair isn't an option. The cost of heating water consumes almost 20 percent of your household budget, second only to what you spend on heating and cooling your home.</p>
<p>Overall, there are situations where a hot water tank is a better choice over a tankless water heater. Vents also need to be installed to ventilate the unit. Low maintenance: With no storage tank to drain, clean, and protect from corrosion, tankless water heaters require less maintenance, and may last longer than traditional storage-tank water heating equipment. Tankless water heater built with condensing technology has lower costs of installation.</p>

And along with that has come the growing technology of tankless residential heaters, which can be helpful for saving money. Your next water heater doesn't have to be an energy hog.</p>

Meeting increased hot water demands can be a challenge for traditional tank-style heaters. No matter the type, brand, or age of your water heater, our team can repair and maintain it. Our local technicians are licensed for gas, electric, and tankless water heater repair.</p>
