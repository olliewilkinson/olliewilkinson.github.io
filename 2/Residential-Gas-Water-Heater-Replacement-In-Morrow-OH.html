<p>So, when your water heater stops working, you need professional help—fast. Once the union is disconnected disconnect the rest of the pipe ONLY on the heater you are replacing. The cost of a space heating water heating combination unit is higher than that of a separate heater and furnace. This requires the services of a qualified commercial plumber who can respond to problems or concerns quickly and professionally.</p>
<p>The first thing to check is for any leaks or standing water near your water heater. If the pilot light is out, follow the instructions posted on the water heater or the details below here to relight the pilot light. Reconnect the wire that was removed from the heating element to perform the resistance check in the previous steps. Visit the pages on different types of water heaters (linked above) for more on estimating costs.</p>

And never work on it if water is pooled on the floor near the appliance.</p>
