<p>These are all symptoms of a failing water tank, and if you catch them early enough, you can avoid total failure by calling a hot water maintenance company for help. We suggest reading up on our Advantage Program to potentially avoid problems with your water heater. Keep in mind, however, that as a trusted water heater contractor, our most important goal when working on your project is to do it correctly, instead of quickly.</p>

Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
