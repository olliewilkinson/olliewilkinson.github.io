<h2>Water Heater Services Darby Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>Other water heater brands currently on the market include: Bradford White, EcoSmart, Rinnai, and State. All you need to do to receive a continuous, consistent supply of hot water is turn the unit on” by just opening the hot water faucet. Showering immediately after running the dishwasher is also out because this activity uses up a lot of hot water and drains the tank significantly. We can come to your house, inspect your water heater, and help you determine the best replacement timeline and option.</p>

<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation Darby</h3>

Estimate how much hot water your household uses during peak hours and look for a heater with a first hour rating (FHR) that meets your demand.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger and deliver it directly to your faucets or shower without storing it in a tank. Another reason that hot water customers prefer the tankless system is for safety purposes. Gas water heaters cost more to install than an electric water heater because of the need to either tap into an existing gas line or bring a gas line to that location ($500), and ventilation must be provided to remove the combustion fumes from the property into the outside air.</p>

Depending on the weather and other components, you have several selections for powering your new water heater.

Yes, one of the main reasons we get called out to a customer's house is their water heater has broken down and isn't supplying hot water anymore. This isn't an issue with tankless water heaters.
