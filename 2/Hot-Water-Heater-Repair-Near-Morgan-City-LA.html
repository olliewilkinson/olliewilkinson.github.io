<p>Water heater usage costs $150 to $700 per year. WATER HARDNESS: Scale deposits that form in a heat exchanger (or on electric heating elements) slow down heat transfer and constrict water flow. The plumbing runs from the heat exchanger in the hot water tank, to the expansion tank, up through the solar collectors above, down through the pressure relief system, and then finally back to the heat exchanger in the tank.</p>
<p>If the pressure is much lower now, you either need to limit your hot water demand or ask a plumber about upgrading your tankless water heater. When problems arise with your home's hot water tank, you want a licensed plumber to always take care of the problem.
