<p>FYI - Some tankless units, such as those made by Rheem , are able to work with a standard ½-inch gas line, provided it isn't longer than 24 feet. A final thing to consider is the expected time to replacement for the hot water heater. In an instant water heater system, the water is already heated to the set temperature as it travels through the pipes. They heat water directly, delivering a continuous flow so you never run out of hot water.</p>

Colder climates mean colder incoming groundwater temperature, resulting in a need for more energy to heat the water to your desired temperature.</p>

Meeting increased hot water demands can be a challenge for traditional tank-style heaters. No matter the type, brand, or age of your water heater, our team can repair and maintain it.
