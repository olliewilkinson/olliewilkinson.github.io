<h2>Water Heater Services San Bruno California</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing. If the water is still as hot as it was before you turned the temperature down, it's because the thermostat isn't working. That's why it's important to regularly maintain and, if necessary, repair your hot water tank — and that's a task that AirPlus Heating & Cooling can assist you with. It is important to know what you have as well as the benefits and disadvantages to making water heater changes, which is why our friendly technicians are here to help.</p>

Our plumbers can inspect and troubleshoot, and also offer maintenance services to help limit the risk of repair issues down the road.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair San Bruno California 94066</h3>
<p>Your water heater would routinely be splashed with water or other liquids. Note: Our Customer Service Professionals are happy to help you determine this information over the phone if you are unable to find the specifications on your current water heater. Gas hot water problems or electric hot water heater problems can sometimes be easily fixed.

<p>At PV, we follow all best practices for installing your water heater - not just code requirements, but every smart precaution and protocol. Looking at the pros and cons for each, a storage tank water heater, and a tankless water heater, you would also need to consider the requirements of your needs and then decide what best suits you. If maintenance is put off and your water heater doesn't get the care it needs, it will eventually lead to repairs.</p>
<p>The process of heating the water is triggered when the tankless hot water heater senses the demand for hot water, which occurs when you turn on the hot water tap. In this case, the expanding water flows into the expansion tank rather than your pipes. Removal of a water heater requires the power source to be disconnected and the tank to be completely drained. Our energy saver installation service saves you time and energy.</p>
<p>Compare this to a setup in a home with a small water heater where, potentially, the second or third person wanting to take a shower might have to wait for 20-30 minutes for the water heater to heat enough water. The main difference between electric and gas water heaters is the heat source. Once power and water supply issues are addressed, a tankless water heater is fairly straightforward to install and is certainly much easier to maneuver into place.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Energy , heating water accounts for about 30 percent of a family's energy bills. They are larger in size compared to the storage tank heaters. When you and your system are ready, we'll oversee the delivery and installation of your new tankless water heater. If you smell gas, or a pungent rotten egg smell near your gas water heater, you should get everyone out of house and get in touch with the local gas company.</p>
