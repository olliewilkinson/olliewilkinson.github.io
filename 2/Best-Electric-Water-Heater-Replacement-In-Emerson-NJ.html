<h2>Water Heater Services Emerson New Jersey</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most common and easiest way to heat water is by the use of a gas hot water heater, and this might be due to the fact that gas is capable of getting the tank up to operating temperature roughly twice as quickly as its electric counterpart, and the cost is also approximately half as much as electricity would cost. Tank water heaters are great and very reliable, but if you are looking for a more energy-efficient that can save you a lot of money, tankless water heaters are the way to go. At All About Plumbing & Septic, we are able to repair and replace tankless water heaters, as well as provide quality water heater installation service More and more people are investing in tankless water heaters because when it's not in use, it doesn't consume energy; with traditional tank water heaters, they are constantly heating water within in a tank.</p>

<p>Water in the storage tank is either heated by a pilot burner or an electrically heated element inside the tank, much like an electric thermos. They also provide an endless supply of hot water since they instantly heat water on demand. While these systems are less prone to wear than hot water heaters with tanks, they do break down over time.
