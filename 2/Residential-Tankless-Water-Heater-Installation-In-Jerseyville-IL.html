<p>The size of the openings for combustion air — from indoors or outdoors — is based upon the tankless unit's Btu input. Tankless water heaters for RVs are becoming increasingly popular specifically for this. I was impressed the first time that I saw a tankless water heater. Even if you have an existing gas line, it may need to be upgraded to a bigger pipe in order to accommodate the power needed to fuel the tankless unit.</p>
<p>Most modern tankless water heaters operate in the range of 11,000 to 199,000 BTUs per hour. If you're planning to sell your home in the near future, and you fear your existing water heater may not last, I would consider the lower upfront cost of a conventional one, or at most upgrade (for the improved marketability) to the high-efficiency gas storage water heater, rather than incurring the additional expense of a whole-home tankless gas water heater.</p>

<p>On-demand water heaters don't require repairs as often as conventional water heaters, but they do need regular service. Tankless water heaters are sized according to its maximum temperature rise possible at a given flow rate. The two pipes coming out of the top of every water heater tank are the supply and delivery pipes ; one is the cold-water inlet pipe and the other is the hot-water outlet pipe The cold-water inlet pipe carries cold water from your home's water supply into the tank where it comes out of the dip tube , filling the tank with water to be heated.</p>
