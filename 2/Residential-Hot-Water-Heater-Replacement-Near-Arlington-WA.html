As always with plumbing equipment, check around for signs of leaks, but keep in mind that not all water around the heater indicates a leak. Alternatively you can combine an indirect water heater to a higher efficiency boiler. Tankless water heater repair insures your tankless water heater operates properly. Your tankless water heater only runs when you need hot water, so it is subjected to less wear and tear than a normal water tank.</p>
