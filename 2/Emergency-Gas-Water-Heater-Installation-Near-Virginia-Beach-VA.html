When setting up a space heating water heating system you need a higher output quick recovery unit for some systems, like an electric forced hot air handler serviced by a hydronic heating coil. In the end, it is putting more pressure on the water heater to work. Our maintenance free heating units help water temperatures stay at safe levels.</p>
<p>Plumbers can contact the plumbers' water heater information line on 1300 883 019 (Monday to Friday, 9.00 am to 5.00 pm) for assistance.
