You will soon hear banging or rumbling sounds from your heater due to the obstruction inside the tank. New home construction is the best time to think about energy saving appliances like tankless hot water heaters, especially for gas heaters that require more home modification.</p>

As the water heats, pressure builds inside the tank. The first tankless water heaters were only about two feet by three feet and bumped out from the wall about 12 or more inches.

You can also save money on the purchase price of a new hot water system replacement, as the WELS water saving shower head help reduce the hot water installation size and cost of the hot water system required.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Mercersburg Pennsylvania 17236</h3>
<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
<p>Depending on your household size and personal energy-saving goals, a tankless water heater may be right for you.

<p>The most popular brands of water heaters are reliable, affordable, have good value and are always available. While tankless water heaters run more efficiently than storage tank water heaters, replacing a tank water heater with a tankless can be expensive, and the payback time can be longer than the warranty.
