<h2>Water Heater Services Waynesboro Virginia</h2>
<p>Installing a tankless gas water heater is a very worthwhile investment and one that will pay for itself in a very short period of time. Without a warranty, you could end up spending a lot more on repairs of an old water heater than you would if you upgraded to a new model. Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed. However, you also have to decide between these three tankless water venting systems: a direct vent system, a non-direct vent system, or an outdoor tankless system.</p>
<p>Propane is available as both traditional tank water heaters starting at $560, and tankless products beginning around $600, other options include a single, wall-mounted, tankless, 1.5 GPM shower unit with a battery powered igniter and a showerhead for approximately $110. A tankless water heater may be the right option for you. Currently, there is too little data to accurately estimate life expectancy for tankless water heaters, but preliminary data shows that tankless water heaters could last up to 20 years.</p>
<p>Install the temperature and pressure relief valve (T&P) discharge pipe so that it flows down toward the discharge point. When debating which water to invest in or switch to, consider these alarming statistics about at-home water usage and the differences between all the water heaters on the market. When you rely on Clarke & Rush for tankless water heater repair or replacement, you can expect professional service from a skilled plumber.</p>

A tankless gas water heater lasts around 20 years, while a traditional gas water heater lasts about 15. New systems are often more reliable as well, so you won't have to worry about running out of hot water at inconvenient times.</p>
<p>John Wood has models to suit every size of home and hot water demand. Installing an instant hot water heater requires careful attention to plumbing and electrical connections to ensure proper appliance functioning. Once you have decided on a power source for your tankless water heater your next step is to determine which brand you would prefer. If you run into the decision of whether to repair or replace your water heater, a good guideline to follow is to never spend more than half the cost of replacing a water heater on the repair.</p>

<p>A conventional water heater is a large tank that takes up a lot of floor space. More Storage Space: Get a lot more storage space in your home by switching to a tankless water heater. A tankless system works by heating water using heating elements as it travels through the system after you turn on the hot water tap.

<p>Our plumbers are water heater repair pros. We can find the problem and get your water heater leakproof in no time. Call or click today to schedule tankless water heater repair and start enjoying endless hot water again. Most manufacturers suggest the life expectancy of a water heater is eight to twelve years. If you only have electricity at your home, it is often cheaper to continue using that fuel source for water heating over paying to bury a propane tank or run a new natural gas line (if that is even a possibility).</p>
<p>Essential, the pressure relief valve protects the water heater against possible overpressure. Because of the way that tankless water heaters heat water, you can often end up with a slug of cold water when hot water is turned on, off, then on again. Eventually, it can burn out the heating elements in your water heater, shortening its lifespan. Open several hot water outlets for a couple of minutes to purge any air from the pipes and water heater.</p>

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
<p>Your water heater may be undersized. When you end up doing a comparison with a tankless gas water heater with that of heater that utilizes both electricity and a tank, you will find the differences are enormous. Bradford White : Being in the water heater business since 1881 these high-efficiency water heaters are great options for any home. Start by shutting off both the water supply of the heater and the electrical power.</p>
<p>Some homeowners find that local building codes have changed and that after their water heater is repaired, upgrades to the venting system, drain pan and other components are needed. Electric water heaters typically last a year or two longer than gas models, but not always. They also tend to have many fewer problems with them than other types of water heating systems. If you need your water heater replaced, we're up for the task.</p>
<p>So in a larger unit with multiple residents—or several units sharing a water heater—it can be tricky to get enough hot water for everyone to shower at the same time, or to do laundry and run the dishwasher at the same time. They are also ideal for families who have small homes and little room for bulky water heaters. Continuous Supply of Hot Water: You never have to worry about running out of hot water, so this option is perfect for homeowners with family members who take long steamy showers.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Energy , heating water accounts for about 30 percent of a family's energy bills. They are larger in size compared to the storage tank heaters. When you and your system are ready, we'll oversee the delivery and installation of your new tankless water heater. If you smell gas, or a pungent rotten egg smell near your gas water heater, you should get everyone out of house and get in touch with the local gas company.</p>
