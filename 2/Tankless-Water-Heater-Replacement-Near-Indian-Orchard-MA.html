When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution. Traditional water heaters work by heating and storing a set amount of water in a tank.

<p>Tankless water heaters, on the other hand, need to heat water as it passes through. There are numerous people that would agree that the storage type of tank hot water heater that is powered by gas is the most efficient machine. A tankless water heater provides hot water only when you need it, which ensures it doesn't produce standby energy losses like a storage water heater. Replaced 40 gallon electric water heater, thermal expansion tank, and pressure reducer valve.</p>
