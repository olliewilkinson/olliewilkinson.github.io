This is due to the fact that hot water tanks store water that can experience what is called "standby" losses, when heat evaporates through the flue or sides of the tank. As your water heater is used day in and day out, expect to have to perform some amount of repair.</p>
<p>A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state: In those colder states with a more drastic rise from the temperature of the incoming water to the desired temperature, the tankless water heater is not able to produce as many GPM.
