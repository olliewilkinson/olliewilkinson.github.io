However, tankless water heaters are more energy efficient because you're only heating water as you need it. A water heater with a tank needs energy to heat up to 100 gallons, for example, and then needs energy to keep it hot all day long or until it's used.</p>
<p>Failed heating elements, faulty water heater thermostats, or discolored water all indicate a problem with your water heater. In this tank, cold water is used to fill the tank, and an element, usually near the top & bottom inside the tank is used to heat it. In between the inside tank and the outer shell is often insulation to help keep the water hot, without the elements having to do all of the work. High efficiency water heaters from Navien deliver endless, on-demand hot water at one or more places in your home.</p>

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out.
