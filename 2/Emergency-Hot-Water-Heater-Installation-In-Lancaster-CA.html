<h2>Water Heater Services Lancaster California</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>The recommended water heater setting of about 115-120 degrees, it keeps your water heater from overheating and save a lot of electricity. Trying to install a water heater yourself can be dangerous and end up costing more than hiring a professional. All forms of flammable material must be kept far away from the heater, while construction components hidden in the wall like wooden supports must be properly insulated from heat in order not to weaken or even ignite as the heater is used over time.</p>
<p>Our technicians are experienced enough to handle all brands and models of water heaters such as Racold, Venus, etc. Relying on your plumber's hot water heater system replacement recommendation may not be the best choice for you or your hot water system installation. If your water heater was plumbed with copper piping, you may need to cut the pipes. If you plan on holding onto the property for some time, a tankless water heater might be a good option.</p>

<p>Tankless water heaters have several advantages over traditional tank-style water heaters. That is why here at Marc Francis Plumbing, we understand how problematic it can be when our water heaters stop working due to old age, leaks, or any other problems you may be experiencing. Some send the unit back others go ahead and install the tank realizing that for the most part the dents are cosmetic and as long as the glass liner is not damaged the water heater will work fine.</p>

In the case of the gas tankless water heater installation you are required to have a PVC vent installed that penetrates the roof of your home or that you mount it on the outside of the home and purchase a special outdoor tankless water heater which may also require an enclosure and re-working your water supply lines.</p>
