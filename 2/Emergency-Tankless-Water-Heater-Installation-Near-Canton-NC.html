<p>FYI - Some tankless units, such as those made by Rheem , are able to work with a standard ½-inch gas line, provided it isn't longer than 24 feet. A final thing to consider is the expected time to replacement for the hot water heater.

<p>These units can heat between 20 to 100 gallons of water. With this type of water heater, a huge amount of hot water can heated as needed instead of storing it in a tank. As such, rather than limiting your business's capabilities to the capacities of your storage tanks, a tankless water heater provides you with an infinite supply of hot water. But if the heater is already too old, and leakage is impossible to repair, then this will definitely mean replacement.</p>
