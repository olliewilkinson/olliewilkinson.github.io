<p>This is an important and a safety component of a hot water heater tank. The conventional heater and storage tank that is installed mostly in garages has undergone some very good improvements that make them much more efficient with a faster recovery period and with less gas or electricity usage. It's just that some water heaters come with a filter screen at the cold water inlet that requires cleaning every once in a while.</p>
<p>For this reason, solar hot water panels actually be a very cost effective and efficient way to provide for all your home heating and hot water needs. Improper water heater installation can lead to a fire, flood or possibly death. Energy savings: Tankless water heaters are also called on demand” water heaters because they only heat water when there is demand for it; i.e., when a hot water tap comes on in the house demanding hot water.</p>
