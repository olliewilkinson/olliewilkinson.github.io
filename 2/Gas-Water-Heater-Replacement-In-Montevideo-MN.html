Thermostatic control, which is the ability of the tankless water heater to modulate power output and give a consistent temperature, is also important, especially for those people on wells. We'll take care of any retrofitting that needs to be performed and get your new tankless water heater dialed in for maximum efficiency.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, you can save up to forty percent on energy bills by using a heater that doesn't have a tank.

However, one should make sure that the tank is installed in a safe place and is secured to a strong structure such as a wall in regions that are prone to earthquake, as it minimizes the chance of a gas fire happening by turning off the gas connection in the event it that the tank falls over.</p>
<p>Because tankless water heaters draw water from your main water line only as you need it, there is no possibility of flooding from this kind of system.
