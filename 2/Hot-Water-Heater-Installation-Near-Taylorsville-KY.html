<p>All households require hot water, so your water heater is one of your most essential home appliances. As the name suggests, this type of water heater does not have a storage tank. Regularly scheduled maintenance can help extend the life of the water heater and it includes performing a water heater flush, checking the valves and connections for leaks and more.
