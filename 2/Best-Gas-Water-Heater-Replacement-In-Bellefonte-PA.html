<p>With hot water pipes adequately insulated with materials like foam pipe insulation sleeves, your plumber can help your home become more energy efficient. Similar to gas-fired tank-type systems, gas-fired tankless systems include a vent that removes any by-products created during the combustion process. Typically, tankless water heaters provide hot water at a rate of 2-5 gallons (7.6-15.2 liters) per minute. If your electric hot water heater is slow to heat, runs out of hot water faster than it used to, or doesn't deliver any hot water at all, there's a 90 percent chance that simply replacing one or both of the heating elements will solve the problem.</p>

Our comprehensive service plan will make sure that your natural gas hot water system is fully maintained to keep it running at peak efficiency all year round.

<p>Many homeowners, however, see benefits of a tankless water heater beyond energy savings. If you are looking for a 55+ gallon electric tank water heater, you will have to purchase a hybrid or heat pump, or a condensate tank if your fuel type is natural gas. Tankless water heaters work in almost any environment when mounted inside or outside your home or business. A water heater expansion tank costs $40 to $200 with labor adding another $50 to $150.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters have been growing in popularity lately, especially with the new water heater energy efficiency regulations. A gas water heater typically will have an EF between 0.50 and 0.80, with electric heaters around 0.90. A higher EF means more energy-efficiency and likely lower operating costs. Hot water system installation cost depends on your plumber. ClimateCare members are trained to repair every make and model of water heater, and update their training when new technologies enter the market.</p>
<p>However, the installation of a Stiebel Eltron electric tankless water heater is relatively simple and can be done by any licenced plumber and electrician. We install and service high quality models throughout the Fresno, CA area. One of the most common problems that we see with electric water heaters in the Ormond Beach, Volusia County, Flagler Beach, Holly Hill, Daytona and Palm Coast areas are the elements in these water heaters going bad.</p>

<p>Circuit breaker for an electric heater trips. Tankless water heaters are perfect for vacation and second homes that are not constantly occupied. Tankless water heaters also use gas to heat water; however, tankless systems heat water on demand instead of expending energy maintaining a full tank of hot water. The water inside of a tankless water heater is less likely to rust. This kind of heater can deliver a nearly endless source of hot water, because it's always heating a big amount of water.</p>
<p>If your water system has a check valve or anti-siphon valve on the supply line, an expansion tank near the cold intake to the heater will likely be necessary. Most smaller units are installed near the point of usage, usually on the wall. Overall, the tankless gas water heaters are not as dangerous to life as the comparable standard tank-type units, although nothing is ever 100% assured. Don't think that your heater will continue to function perfectly for many decades, regardless of how modern and expensive yours is. Hot water heater can go for many years without needing repair, but they always eventually malfunction and need fixing or replacing.</p>

<p>Some of these heaters are more energy efficient than other kinds. The purchase price of gas powered heaters may be a little bit higher, but they are cheaper to operate overall. Also, since combustion takes place in the heating process using gas there needs to be adequate ventilation for both combustion (fresh air flow) and exhaust.
